  MOOSE-based applications take text-based input files (NOTE: We do not have a card reader for MOOSE and therefore **DO NOT HAVE INPUT DECKS** :-).  The syntax for these input files can be dumped out of any MOOSE-based application using:

```bash
./app-opt --dump
```

We also take this information and turn it into handy web-pages that you can access below:

* [MOOSE]
* [MOOSE With Modules](/modules/index.md)
