## Preconditioning
---

- Krylov methods need preconditioning to be efficient (or even effective!).
- Even though the Jacobian is never formed, JFNK methods still require preconditioning.
- MOOSE's automatic (without user intervention) preconditioning is fairly minimal.
- Many options exist for implementing improved preconditioning in MOOSE.

## Preconditioned JFNK
---

- Using right preconditioning, solve

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{R}'(\boldsymbol{u}_i) \boldsymbol{M}^{-1} (\boldsymbol{M} \delta \boldsymbol{u}_{i+1}) = -\boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{u}_i)
\end{equation}

- $$\boldsymbol{M}$$ symbolically represents the preconditioning matrix or process
- Inside GMRES, we only apply the action of $$\boldsymbol{M}^{-1}$$ on a vector
- Right preconditioned matrix free version

    $$\boldsymbol{R}' (\boldsymbol{u}_i) \boldsymbol{M}^{-1}\boldsymbol{v} \approx \frac{\boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{u}_i + \epsilon \boldsymbol{M}^{-1}\boldsymbol{v}) - \boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{u}_i)}{\epsilon}$$

## Preconditioning Matrix vs Process
---

- On the previous slide $$\boldsymbol{M}$$ represented the "Preconditioning Matrix".
- The action of $$\boldsymbol{M}^{-1}$$ on a vector represents the "Preconditioner" or "Preconditioning Process".
- In MOOSE the "matrix to build" and the "process to apply" with that matrix are separated.
- There are four different ways to build preconditioning matrices:
    - Default: Block Diagonal Preconditioning
    - Single Matrix Preconditioner (SMP)
    - Finite Difference Preconditioner (FDP)
    - Physics Based Preconditioner (PBP)
- After selecting how to build a preconditioning matrix you can then use solver options to select how to apply the Preconditioner.

## Solve Type
---

- The default `solve_type` for MOOSE is "Preconditioned JFNK".
- An alternative `solve_type` can be set through either the `[Executioner]` or `[Preconditioner/*]` block.
- Valid options include:
    - `PJFNK` (default)
    - `JFNK`
    - `NEWTON`
    - `FD` (Finite Difference)

## PETSc Preconditioning Options
---

- For specifying the preconditioning process we use solver options directly (i.e. PETSc options).
- Currently the options for preconditioning with PETSc are exposed to the applications.
- This will change in the future. . . there will be more generic ways of specifying preconditioning parameters.
- The best place to learn about all of the preconditioning options with PETSc is the user manual.
- We use the command-line syntax, but provide places to enter it into the input file.

## Default Preconditioning Matrix
---

-   Consider the fully coupled system of equations:

$$$
- \nabla \cdot k(s,T) \nabla T  = 0 \\
- \nabla \cdot D(s,T) \nabla s  = 0
$$$

-   Fully coupled Jacobian approximation

$$$
\boldsymbol{R}'(s,T) =
 \begin{bmatrix}
   (\boldsymbol{R}_T)_T & (\boldsymbol{R}_T)_s
   \\
   (\boldsymbol{R}_s)_T & (\boldsymbol{R}_s)_s
 \end{bmatrix}
 \approx
 \begin{bmatrix}
   (\boldsymbol{R}_T)_T & \boldsymbol{0}
   \\
   \boldsymbol{0}       & (\boldsymbol{R}_s)_s
 \end{bmatrix}
$$$

-   For our example:

$$$
\boldsymbol{M} \equiv
    \begin{bmatrix}
      (k(s,T) \nabla \phi_j, \nabla \psi_i) & \boldsymbol{0} \\
      \boldsymbol{0} & (D(s,T) \nabla \phi_j, \nabla\psi_i)
    \end{bmatrix} \approx \boldsymbol{R}'(s,T)
$$$

- This simple style of throwing away the off-diagonal blocks is the way MOOSE will precondition when using the default `solve_type`.

## The Preconditioning Block
---

```pre
[Preconditioning]
  active = 'my_prec'

  [./my_prec]
    type = SMP
    # SMP Options Go Here!
    # Override PETSc Options Here!
  [../]

  [./other_prec]
    type = PBP
    # PBP Options Go Here!
    # Override PETSc Options Here!
  [../]
[]
```

- The `Preconditioning` block allows you to define which type of preconditioning matrix to build and what process to apply.
- You can define multiple blocks with different names, allowing you to quickly switch out preconditioning options.
- Each sub-block takes a `type` parameter to specify the type of preconditioning matrix.
- Within the sub-blocks you can also provide other options specific to that type of preconditioning matrix.
- You can also override PETSc options here.
- Only one block can be active at a time.

## Single Matrix Preconditioning (SMP)
---

- The Single Matrix Preconditioner (SMP) builds one matrix for preconditioning.
- You enable SMP with:

```pre
type = SMP
```

- You specify which blocks of the matrix to use with:

```pre
off_diag_row    = 's'
off_diag_column = 'T'
```

- Which would produce an $$\boldsymbol{M}$$ like this:

$$$
\boldsymbol{M} \equiv
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \left(k(s,T) \nabla \phi_j, \nabla \psi_i\right) & \boldsymbol{0}
      \\[3pt]
      \left(\frac{\partial D(s,T)}{\partial T_j} \nabla s, \nabla \psi_i\right) & \left(D(s,T) \nabla \phi_j, \nabla\psi_i\right)
    \end{bmatrix} \approx \boldsymbol{R}'
$$$

- In order for this to work you must provide a `computeQpOffDiagJacobian()` function in your Kernels that computes the required partial derivatives.
- To use *all* off diagonal blocks, you can use the following input file syntax:

```pre
full = true
```

## Finite Difference Preconditioning (FDP)
---

- The Finite Difference Preconditioner (FDP) allows you to form a "Numerical Jacobian" by doing direct finite differences of your residual statements.
- This is extremely slow and inefficient, but is a great debugging tool because it allows you to form a nearly perfect preconditioner.
- More information can be found here: <http://mooseframework.org/wiki/JacobianDebugging/>
- You specify it by using:

```pre
type = FDP
```

- You can use the same options for specifying off-diagonal blocks as SMP.
- Since FDP allows you to build the perfect approximate Jacobian it can be useful to use it directly to solve instead of using JFNK.
- The finite differencing is sensitive to the differencing parameter which can be specified using:

```pre
petsc_options_iname = '-mat_fd_coloring_err -mat_fd_type'
petsc_options_value = '1e-6                 ds'
```

## Examples
---

```pre
[Executioner]
  ...
  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_hypre_type -ksp_gmres_restart'
  petsc_options_value = 'hypre    boomeramg      101'
  ...
[]
```

- Default Preconditioning Matrix, Preconditioned JFNK, monitor linear solver, variable linear solver tolerance.
- Use Hypre with algebraic multigrid and store 101 Krylov vectors.

```pre
[Preconditioning]
  active = 'SMP_jfnk'

  [./SMP_jfnk]
    type = SMP

    off_diag_row    = 'forced'
    off_diag_column = 'diffused'

    petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type'
    petsc_options_value = 'lu'
  [../]
[]
```

## Physics Based Preconditioning
---

- Physics based preconditioning is an advanced concept used to more efficiently solve using JFNK.
- The idea is to create a preconditioning process that targets each physics individually.
- In this way you can create a more effective preconditioner. . . while also maintaining efficiency.
- In MOOSE there is a `PhysicsBasedPreconditioner` object.
- This object allows you to dial up a preconditioning matrix and the operations to be done on the different blocks of that matrix on the fly from the input file.

## What the PBP Does
---

- The PBP works by partially inverting a preconditioning matrix (usually an approximation of the true Jacobian) by partially inverting each block row in a Block-Gauss-Seidel way.

$$$
\boldsymbol{R}(u,v) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{R}_u
    \\
    \boldsymbol{R}_v
  \end{bmatrix}
$$$

$$$
\boldsymbol{M} \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
  (\boldsymbol{R}_u)_u & \boldsymbol{0}
  \\
  (\boldsymbol{R}_v)_u & (\boldsymbol{R}_v)_v
\end{bmatrix} \approx \boldsymbol{R}'
$$$

$$$
\boldsymbol{M} \boldsymbol{q} = \boldsymbol{p} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
(\boldsymbol{R}_u)_u \boldsymbol{q}_u &=& \boldsymbol{p}_u \\[6pt]
(\boldsymbol{R}_v)_v \boldsymbol{q}_v &=& \boldsymbol{p}_v - (\boldsymbol{R}_v)_u \boldsymbol{q}_u
\end{array}
\right.
$$$

## Using the PBP
---

```pre
[Variables]
  ...
[]

[Preconditioning]
  active = 'myPBP'

  [./myPBP]
    type = PBP
    solve_order = 'u v'
    preconditioner  = 'ILU AMG'
    off_diag_row    = 'v'
    off_diag_column = 'u'
  [../]
[]
```

- Set up a PBP object for a two variable system (consisting of variables "u" and "v").
- Use ILU for the "u" block and AMG for "v".
- Use the lower diagonal (v,u) block.
- When using â€˜`type=PBP`', MOOSE will set `solve_type = JFNK` automatically.
