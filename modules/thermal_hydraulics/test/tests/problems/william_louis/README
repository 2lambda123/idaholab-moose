This directory contains files modeling the junction experiments described
in the following reference:

M.J.P. William-Louis et al. On the calculation of unsteady compressible flow through
an N-branch junction. Proc. Instn. Mech. Engrs. 212 (1998) 49-56.

Experimental data was extracted from plot images in this reference using a plot digitizer.

Three cases were considered in the experiments, given the following names here:
- 3pipes_open: 3 pipes, with pipes 2 and 3 open
- 4pipes_open: 4 pipes, with pipes 2, 3, and 4 open
- 4pipes_closed: 4 pipes, with pipes 2, 3, and 4 closed

The following files are in this directory:
- junction_3pipes_open.i: input file for the "3pipes_open" case
- junction_4pipes_closed.i: input file for the "4pipes_closed" case
- 3pipes_open_pipe1_048.csv: "3pipes_open" experimental data for pipe 1, 0.48 m from junction
- 3pipes_open_pipe1_313.csv: "3pipes_open" experimental data for pipe 1, 3.13 m from junction
- 3pipes_open_pipe2_052.csv: "3pipes_open" experimental data for pipe 2, 0.52 m from junction
- 3pipes_open_pipe3_048.csv: "3pipes_open" experimental data for pipe 3, 0.48 m from junction
- plot_3pipes_open.py: plot script for "3pipes_open" case
- plot_4pipes_closed.py: plot script for "4pipes_closed" case

The experimental data files have the following columns:
- dp: Pressure difference [kPa], relative to low pressure state (100 kPa)
- time: Time [s]
