# XFEM Action

!syntax description /XFEM/XFEMAction

## Overview

The `XFEMAction` takes in parameters that generally apply to how one wants to use XFEM and provides
these to the `XFEMApp`. The choice for quadrature weighting method is found in the `qrule`
variable. Various output options can be specified in `debug_output_level`, and XFEM cuts can be
visualized on Exodus mesh files with the `output_cut_plane` variable.

Parameters specific to cracking application cases are also present in this action. For cracks that
grow according to a consistent increment, `use_crack_growth_increment` and `crack_growth_increment`
can be defined. To employ enrichments for cracks with tips ending within an element,
`use_crack_tip_enrichment` can be set to `true` and parameters used in the crack tip enrichment must
be detailed: `crack_front_definition`, `displacements`, `enrichment_displacements`,
`cut_off_boundary`, `cut_off_radius`.

For a more detailed description of what objects are generated by employing the various options
available in this action, please see the [XFEM Action syntax](syntax/XFEM/index.md) page.
