# EBCalcTermsTest

!syntax description /Materials/EBCalcTermsTest

Tests to see if gradient and second derivative components of coupled variables works with Function Parser.

This file sets up a small system of 2 grains and uses ExpressionBuilder to create a function of the coupled variables and their first and second derivative components relating to those two grains.

Description of the `ExpressionBuilder` system is found [here](ExpressionBuilder.md).
