# ADComputeFiniteStrainElasticStress

This material is a version of
[ComputeFiniteStrainElasticStress](/materials/ComputeFiniteStrainElasticStress.md)
which uses forward mode automatic differentiation to carry along derivatives of
its material properties for use with the automatic differentiation tensor
mechanics kernels (such as
[ADStressDivergence](/kernels/ADStressDivergenceTensors.md)).
