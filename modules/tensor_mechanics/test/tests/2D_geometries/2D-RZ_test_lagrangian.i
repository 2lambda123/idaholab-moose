# Considers the mechanics solution for a thick spherical shell that is uniformly
# pressurized on the inner and outer surfaces, using 2D axisymmetric geometry.
# This test uses the strain calculators ComputeLagrangianAxisymmetricRZStrain which
# are generated by the TensorMechanics MasterAction depending on the cli_args given in
# the tests file.
#
# From Roark (Formulas for Stress and Strain, McGraw-Hill, 1975), the radially-dependent
# circumferential stress in a uniformly pressurized thick spherical shell is given by:
#
# S(r) = [ Pi[ri^3(2r^3+ro^3)] - Po[ro^3(2r^3+ri^3)] ] / [2r^3(ro^3-ri^3)]
#
#   where:
#          Pi = inner pressure
#          Po = outer pressure
#          ri = inner radius
#          ro = outer radius
#
# The tests assume an inner and outer radii of 5 and 10, with internal and external
# pressures of 100000 and 200000, respectively. The resulting compressive tangential
# stress is largest at the inner wall and, from the above equation, has a value
# of -271429.
