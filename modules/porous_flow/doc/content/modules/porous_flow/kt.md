# How to use Kuzmin-Turek stabilization in PorousFlow simulations

Kuzmin and Turek [citep:KuzminTurek2004] describe a method of stabilising advection while minimising artificial numerical diffusion.  In this page "Kuzmin and Turek" is abbreviatved to "KT".   Basic features of KT's approach are detailed in [a worked example](kt_worked.md) and the results are compared with full upwinding, RDG and no stabilization in the [numerical diffusion page](numerical_diffusion.md).

This page is for users who want to use KT stabilization in PorousFlow simulations.
