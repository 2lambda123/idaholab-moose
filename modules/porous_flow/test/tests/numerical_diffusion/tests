    requirement = "1D RDG shall allow arbitrary 1D velocities to be specified.  This test demonstrates the advection of a tracer in 1D using the RDG module.  There is no slope limiting.  Changing the SlopeLimiting scheme to minmod, mc, or superbee means that a linear reconstruction is performed, and the slope limited according to the scheme chosen.  Doing this produces RDG(P0P1) and substantially reduces numerical diffusion"
