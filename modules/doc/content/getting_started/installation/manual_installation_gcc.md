# Manual Installation GCC/MPICH

The following instructions are for those who wish to build their own custom compiler stack.

These instructions were created as a reference during a time when MOOSE had no means at which to
distribute pre-built binaries. Therefor the commands you see here were never meant to be blindly
'cut and pasted' into your terminal.

## Prerequisites

!include manual_prereqs.md

!include manual_gcc.md

!include manual_mpich_gcc.md

With the compiler stack ready, you can proceed to
[Obtaining and Building MOOSE](getting_started/installation/install_moose.md).
