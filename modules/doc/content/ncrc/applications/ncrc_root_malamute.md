The MOOSE Application Library for Advanced Manufacturing UTilitiEs, or MALAMUTE, is a simulation code for a variety of advanced manufacturing processes designed to connect the microscale characteristics and evolution of materials with their engineering scale, post-manufacture performance. MALAMUTE currently models electric field assisted sintering (EFAS, also known as spark plasma sintering) and laser surface heating (deformation, melting, and welding). Additive manufacturing capabilities are also under development. MALAMUTE leverages and builds on the MOOSE modules to provide a wide range of multiphysics capability up to three dimensions utilizing the finite element and finite volume methods. MALAMUTE is only available via source access on the [!ac](INL) GitHub instance, via [!ac](NCRC).
