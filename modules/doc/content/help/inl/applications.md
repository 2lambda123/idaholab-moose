# NCRC Applications

[!ac](NCRC) distributes a number of [!ac](NEAMS)-developed applications. The following sections
highlight some of the codes available through the NCRC.

NCRC applications may be obtained by outside institutions and individuals for execution and/or
development. Currently, the following access methods are available for certain applications:

- +HPC Binary Access (Level 1)+\\
  Users in the category will be provided an INL-HPC account that includes a binary version of
  the desired application ready for use on INL-HPC resources.

- +Binary Access (Level 2)+\\
  Users in this category will be provided with access to a binary version of the desired
  application that is executable on non-INL systems, such as a personal workstation or institution
  cluster.

- +Source Code Access (Level 4)+\\
  Users in this category will be provided with complete source code access to an application. This
  level of access is reserved for individuals that will be developing new capabilities for the
  application and contributing directly to the project.

### Requesting Access

To request access to an [!ac](NEAMS)-developed code, please follow the instructions on
[INL's Nuclear Computational Resource Center](https://inl.gov/ncrc/) website.

!alert tip title=Existing HPC GitLab Users
For existing users who access codes via [hpcgitlab.hpc.inl.gov](https://hpcgitlab.hpc.inl.gov),
please see the [Transition Guide](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/wiki/NCRC-github.inl.gov-transition-guide)
for help on accessing the new home for NCRC source code (level 4): [github.inl.gov](https://github.inl.gov). New users can safely ignore this notice.
