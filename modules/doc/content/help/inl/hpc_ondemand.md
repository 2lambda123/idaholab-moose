# HPC OnDemand

[HPC OnDemand](https://hpcondemand.inl.gov/pun/sys/dashboard), is a service provided by the INL, which allows a user direct access to the resources contained within the HPC enclave via their web browser. In order to utilize this service, you must first [request an account](https://modsimcode.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx).

Once your request has been accepted, and you have the necessary credentials provided by the HPC team, head on over to [HPC OnDemand](https://hpcondemand.inl.gov/pun/sys/dashboard).


## Shell Prompt

One of the more exciting features of HPC OnDemand, is having a terminal-like window using a web browser:

!media large_media/hpc/hpcondemand_terminal.png style=filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.25rem black);

With this prompt, you can access the PBS job scheduler, obtain a Civet-like testing environment, and basically anything else a traditional terminal window would otherwise allow.

 shell prompt is obtained, by clicking on 'Clusters' and selecting any of the desired HPC machines. Each machine is reachable by the other via SSH. The terminal window is text based, making it very responsive, and simple to cut and paste command results.
