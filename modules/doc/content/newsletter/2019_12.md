parallel with minimal memory impact. Please refer to [distributed_samples.md] for more information.

## Miscellaneous enhancements and bug fixes

- The TestHarness now properly detects failures in the Part1 test when using the --recover flag.
- "Timed Print" formatting fixed when a nested call to this utility is made.
- Don't allow the use of "contains_complete_history" parameter in `FeatureVolumeVectorPostprocessor`.
- BoundaryRenameGenerator bug fix when `old_boundary_name` is used.

All python-based utilities within MOOSE (e.g., the test harness, peacock, and MooseDocs) have
been upgraded to utilize Python 3, which some maintaining support for Python 2.
