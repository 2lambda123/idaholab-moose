## Improved Stochastic Tools Sampler API

The Sampler base class was updated to include a more efficient API for computing sample data in
parallel with minimal memory impact. Please refer to [distributed_samples.md] for more information.

## Miscellaneous enhancements and bug fixes

- The TestHarness now properly detects failures in the Part1 test when using the --recover flag.
- "Timed Print" formatting fixed when a nested call to this utility is made.
- Don't allow the use of "contains_complete_history" parameter in `FeatureVolumeVectorPostprocessor`.
- BoundaryRenameGenerator bug fix when `old_boundary_name` is used.
