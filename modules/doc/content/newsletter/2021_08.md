## AD Scalar Kernels

Scalar kernels can now use [automatic differentiation (AD)](automatic_differentiation/index.md).
While AD is not necessary for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
involving only scalar variables (due to the exact Jacobians offered by
[ParsedODEKernel.md], for example), ODEs involving contributions from field
variables greatly benefit from AD. For example, an elemental user object may
compute an `ADReal` value from field variable(s) on a domain, which then may
be used in a scalar equation.

To create an AD scalar kernel, derive from `ADScalarKernel` and implement the
method `computeQpResidual()`. As a caution, if using user objects to compute
`ADReal` values, be sure to execute those user objects on `NONLINEAR` to
ensure the derivatives in the `ADReal` value are populated.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- In [ExplicitSSPRungeKutta.md], a bug was fixed where a segmentation fault was
  occurring in some corner cases when using automatic differentiation, due to
  calling `computeADTimeDerivatives` before initializing some stage data, even
  though in these cases, the resulting value is not used. Now, a quiet NaN is
  returned instead of trying to use an invalid pointer.
