## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.09.09` Update
- Performance logging via `PerfLog` has been added to more of the
  `ExodusII` interface.
- The `Parameters` class `print_helper()` has been overloaded to
  handle nested vector-of-vectors-of-vectors parameters, so
  `Parameter<T>::print()` can now operate with that type as `T`.
- `ExodusII::write_added_sides()` support, which can be turned on to
  automatically generate "side elements" in output, useful for
  visualization of `SIDE_DISCONTINUOUS` data fields which are
  discontinuous on true elements' edges and vertices.
- Overloads for `TypeTensor` and `TypeVector` classes in the
  template metafunctions `RawType` and `ReplaceAlgebraicType`.
- A new `TensorTraits` class, for easier writing of generic algorithms
  that can handle scalar, vector, and tensor classes.
- Code refactoring and bug fixes, including

  - Fixed preconditioner reuse in the `PetscNonlinearSolver`
    interface when combined with Adaptive Mesh Refinement
  - Fixed the `Poly2TriTriangulator` refinement code behavior when
    it is told not to refine at all.
  - Fixed `MeshedHole` boundary orientation issues, thereby fixing a
    bug when `Poly2TriTriangulator` is required to refine a hole
    boundary initially defined by another mesh.
  - Fixed fragile `SIDE_DISCONTINUOUS` behavior when combined with
    other variable types on a `HEX27`.

- More test coverage
