## Stochastic Tools

The [stochastic tools module](modules/stochastic_tools/index.md) is under heavy development and has
gained some powerful features, with many more to come in the near future.

1. Support for distributed VectorPostprocessor (VPP) data was added to the framework. This allows
   massively parallel stochastic simulations to be performed with minimal memory impact. The VPP
   must be programmed to support data that is distributed or replicated. The mode of operation
   is controlled by the "parallel_type" parameter. When set to distributed mode an output file
   for each processor will be created.

2. The VPP statistics calculator was generalized to support replicated and distributed VPP data as
   well as for multiple vectors, see [vectorpostprocessors/Statistics.md].

3. Support for computing bootstrap confidence level intervals was added to the statistics calculator,
   see [vectorpostprocessors/Statistics.md].

4. An [XML](XMLOutput.md) output object was created to allow for single file VPP output.
