## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.08.17` Update

- Don't leak temporary Netgen `LDFLAGS` into `libmesh_LDFLAGS`.
- Include `<memory>` in `getpot.h` for more compiler compatibility.
- Implemented an improved `ASPECT_RATIO` quality metric for Quad elements.
- Added `Quad::quality(WARP)` implementation.
- Added unit tests for mesh smoothers.
- Fixed `ReplicatedMesh(DistributedMesh &)` construction.
- Report a more useful error message when asked to tetrahedralize a broken boundary.
- Add `Elem::edges_adjacent_to_node()` API
- Allow all Petsc matrix types to proceed from a common base class.
- Call netgen only on rank 0, then broadcast, for better reliability when tetrahedralizing in parallel.
- Add generic `Elem::quality(MIN,MAX_DIHEDRAL_ANGLE)` implementation.
- Close solution before zeroing for eigen systems.
- Add matrix iterator APIs to match vector iterator APIs.
- Fixes for compilations using single/triple/quadruple precision
- Netgen handling for unprepared inputs, non-contained holes

## PETSc-level Changes

### PETSc updated to 3.21.4

The `moose-petsc` package has been updated alongside the MOOSE repository submodule to version 3.21.4.
Consequently, the `moose-dev` conda environment was updated to version `2024.08.05`. All `moose-dev`
packages versioned after this date should contain PETSc 3.21.4. To obtain a newer version of the MOOSE
development packages, please follow our [getting started instructions](getting_started/index.md)
and create a new MOOSE conda environment. Alternatively, one may also attempt an update of their
current conda environment by performing the following commands, assuming that your development
environment is named `moose`:

```bash
conda activate moose
conda update moose-dev
```
