## MOOSE Improvements

### New Physics action syntax

The [Physics](syntax/Physics/index.md) syntax has been added to MOOSE. The `Physics` system is meant
to streamline the input of an set of physical equations in MOOSE. For example, this might allow the
definition of the required equations automatically but also the selection of good default parameters
and preconditioners. `Physics` are derived from [Actions](source/actions/Action.md) but define additional
APIs to facilitate the implementation of a new `Physics` action. As appropriate, some of the modules'
actions that defined equations will be transitioned to the `Physics` system over the coming months.

### Separation of the Materials and FunctorMaterials block

[Functor materials](syntax/FunctorMaterials/index.md) were added to MOOSE to
allow evaluation of material properties at arbitrary locations, such as element
faces or nodes. These materials do not define traditional material properties as in the
[Material](syntax/Materials/index.md) system, but instead they define
[Functors](syntax/Functors/index.md). To mark the difference between the two systems,
the two types of objects should no longer be created in the same `[Materials]` block;
FunctorMaterials should be created inside a `[FunctorMaterials]` block.

### Improvements in the Navier Stokes Module

- The k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model was added. This method enables more accurate turbulence modeling compared to the current mixing-length model.
- A drift-flux mixture model was added which enables solutions of two-phase flows where the phases move at different velocities but assume local equilibrium over short spatial length scales.

### Field Split Additions

Field splits can now be nested within each other. Moreover a [NavierStokesProblem.md] was introduced
that allows for scalable preconditioning of the Navier-Stokes equations for low to moderate Reynolds
numbers. The Least Squared Commutator preconditioning techniques employed have been demonstrated on
problem sizes up to 70 million degrees of freedom.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.01.23` Update

- New example illustrating a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin solve
- Added new finite element support: the `HIERARCHIC_VEC` FE family,
  for vector-valued hierarchic shape functions, and the
  `L2_HIERARCHIC_VEC` FE family, for the broken/L2 version of that
  space.  Added simple-vector-valued example and
  Hybridized-Discontinuous-Galerkin example runs using these families.
- Support for a pre-check object callback from PetscNonlinearSolver
- Keep track of libMesh command line queries, and avoid spurious
  unused-option warnings about them from PETSc
- Support for upgrading the order of mixed-order input meshes in
  `all_second_order()` and `all_complete_order()`
- Support for neighbor-finding and mesh stitching with mixed-order
  input meshes.  Mixed-order meshes must still be upgraded before
  being used to support C0 finite element types in a linear solve
  (where constraint equations would be needed between
  incompatible-order neighbors), but mesh generation and modification
  with pre-upgraded mixed-order meshes is now possible.
- Support for more preconditioning options in EigenSparseLinearSolver;
  this allows us to reenable a dozen examples that were previously
  skipped when Eigen was configured as the default linear algebra
  package.
- Minor fixes to reduced basis code, string parsing of uncommon
  quadrature rule names, configuration on systems without stdlib.h,
- Minor clarifications and typo fixes in documentation, comments, and
  runtime error messages
- Fixes for VTK .pvtu reading, and preservation of libMesh node, element,
  and subdomain ids written to VTK files
- `Elem::volume()` no longer can throw an exception when called on an
  element without an invertible mapping; hence `print_info()` and
  `get_info()` are now safe to use when emitting debugging messages about
  twisted geometric elements.
- Support `interior_parent` in `Elem` order upgrades
- Avoid creating duplicate entries in `BoundaryInfo` multimaps
- Removes an overzealous assertion in variable name collection that
  does not work with `NodeElem`-only meshes

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- Shorthand functor material property output was added using the [!param](/FunctorMaterials/GenericFunctorMaterial/output_properties) parameter. This automatically creates a [FunctorAux.md] and a constant monomial variable for output, which had to be done manually before.
- Extra element IDs can now be used to assign elements to subdomains in the [ParsedSubdomainMeshGenerator.md].
- The [PropertyReadFile.md] user object can now read multiple files, once every time it is executed. The execution is controlled with the [!param](/UserObjects/PropertyReadFile/execute_on) parameter.
