## MOOSE Improvements

### Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods

We have added the ability to implement hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
methods. Thus far, we have added HDG discretizations of diffusion and
Navier-Stokes physics. For more information about HDG, please visit the
[HDG overview page](HDGKernels/index.md). More information about HDG
Navier-Stokes can be accessed [here](NavierStokesHDGKernel.md).

### Override parameters when using included files

Either of following syntaxes can now be used to override parameters from included files:

```
param := value
param :override= value
```

See [Parameter override syntax](application_usage/input_syntax.md) for more information.

### Added radiation coupling component between multiple 2D heat structures

In the [Thermal hydraulics module](modules/thermal_hydraulics/index.md), the
component [HSCoupler2D2DRadiation.md] was added, which couples any number of
2D heat structures together via radiation, using gray, diffuse assumptions.
