## MOOSE Improvements

### Framework changes

The [Physics](Physics/index.md) syntax was introduced into MOOSE. `Physics` are a derived class of
[Actions](Action.md) that is introduced to offer more commonality between `Actions` that implement
most of an equation for a certain physics of interest. Ultimately, this should enable the simplified
definition of physics onto generalized [Components](Components/index.md).

The [MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer.md]-derived classes can now perform arbitrary N-to-M siblings transfer.
Siblings transfer are transfer between two multiapps without copying any information on the parent application.
This flexibility enables more efficient multiphysics coupling, and generally facilitates the setup of multiphysics
simulation in which each physics solve is segregated in a separate [MultiApp](MultiApps/index.md).


### Solid mechanics module

The Tensor Mechanics module has been renamed to the Solid Mechanics module. The tensor mechanics
module started out as an alternative implementation of the solid mechanics equation from the old
solid mechanics module. The old solid mechanics module was removed in 2020. Four years later,
we expect that re-using the solid mechanics module name will not cause much, if any, disruption.

Concurrently, the following syntax changes were made for the major [Actions](Action.md) in the module.
For example, the main action was changed from:

```
[Modules]
  [TensorMechanics]
    [Master]
     ...
```

to the new syntax:

```
[Physics]
  [SolidMechanics]
    [QuasiStatic]
     ...
```

Summary of syntax changes:

!table caption=Syntax replacements
| Old syntax | New syntax |
| - | - |
| Modules/TensorMechanics/Master | Physics/SolidMechanics/QuasiStatic |
| Modules/TensorMechanics/DynamicMaster | Physics/SolidMechanics/Dynamic |
| Modules/TensorMechanics/GeneralizedPlaneStrain | Physics/SolidMechanics/GeneralizedPlainStrain |
| Modules/TensorMechanics/CohesiveZoneMaster | Physics/SolidMechanics/CohesiveZone |
| Modules/TensorMechanics/LineElementMaster | Physics/SolidMechanics/LineElement/QuasiStatic |

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- The [PropertyFileReader.md] is now able to delay reading files until its first execution, bypassing
  the loading of the CSV data at construction.
- The Spline-Based-Table-Lookup fluid properties can now be used with the finite volume fully-coupled incompressible
  flow discretization of the Navier Stokes equations, by setting the [!param](/FunctorMaterials/GeneralFunctorFluidProps/neglect_derivatives_of_density_time_derivative) parameter to true
- The [CoarsenBlockGenerator.md] was added to MOOSE. Its features are limited and only include coarsening a previously-refined
  mesh for which the refinement information was lost.
