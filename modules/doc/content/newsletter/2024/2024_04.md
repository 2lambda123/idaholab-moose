## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.04.23` Update

- Improved TriangulatorInterface compatibility with quadratic elements
  in boundary and hole meshes, including adjusting triangulation
  elements to match curved boundaries.  This feature is not yet
  compatible with mid-triangulation boundary refinement.
- Added scaling options to Empirical Interpolation Method in
  Reduced-Basis code, handling for cases with linearly dependent
  data, and update plotting.
- Fixed bugs in visualization output of Lagrange data on Tri7, in
  `DirichletBoundary` application on nodesets generated from sidesets,
  and in FEMContext quadrature selection for cases where the first
  variable of a system is higher-order than any of the variables being
  queried by the context.  This last fix prevents excessive numbers of
  quadrature points from being used in some MOOSE GeneralField
  transfer operations.
