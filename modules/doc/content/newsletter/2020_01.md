## Grid Sequencing

MOOSE now supports grid sequencing, a technique in which a coarse grid solution
is used as an initial guess for the fine grid solve. Current support is only for
steady problems. Grid sequencing is useful
when solving highly nonlinear problems because the initial guess is much nearer
Newton's quadratic basin of convergence, which can result in significantly fewer
non-linear iterations during the fine solve. Using grid sequencing is as simple
as specifying `num_grids=<n>` in the `Executioner` block. When using grid
sequencing, you should provide a mesh corresponding to the coarsest grid to be
solved. An example for use of grid sequencing in mechanical contact is given in
[this input](bouncing-block-contact/grid-sequencing/grid-sequencing.i). Support
for grid sequencing support for transient problems is planned
soon.

## RANFS Mechanical Contact

The `Contact` module now has objects for solving frictionless mechanical contact using a
RANFS algorithm, where RANFS stands for Reduced Active Nonlinear Function
Set. RANFS has the following advantages:

- Exactly solves the non-penetration condition; no `penalty` parameter is
  required
- Because no `penalty` parameter is required, there are no detrimental effects
  on the condition number of the system matrix
- Exact constraint enforcement is achieved without requiring explicit Lagrange
  Multiplier variables, which means:
    - No additional degrees of freedom
    - Important Matrix properties are preserved, e.g. if the structure of the matrix
      resulting from `Kernels` is positive-definite, then the matrix
      will remain positive-definite after application of the frictionless
      contact constraints. This allows use of multigrid methods which cannot be
      used in saddle-point problems that usually arise if using Lagrange
      Multipliers

The RANFS algorithm should make its way into the `ContactAction` shortly. An
implementation for frictional contact is also planned. A RANFS example can be
found [here](bouncing-block-contact/bouncing-block-ranfs.i).

## MONOMIAL_VEC support

MOOSE now supports the `MONOMIAL_VEC FEFamily`. This can be useful for example
if forming a vector from the gradient of another variable. `MONOMIAL_VEC` is now
used for the velocity auxiliary variable in MOOSE's
[`darcy_mech` tutorial](darcy_thermo_mech/step04_velocity_aux/problems/step4.i).
