## MOOSE Improvements

### Support for p-refinement

MOOSE now supports p-refinement, e.g. refining or coarsening the order of
the finite element basis functions. In order to use p-refinement, you
can simply set `switch_h_to_p_refinement=true` in the `Adaptivity` block.
As suggested by the parameter name, only one of h- or p-refinement may be used
in a single simulation.

### Console time formatting

MOOSE now has a new input parameter "time_format" for console outputs to control
how times are printed during transient simulations. It is noted that MOOSE always
use time in seconds internally for the simulations. The parameter can accept one
of the six options, plain, second, minute, hour, day and dtime. It can be used with
the following input syntax

```
[Outputs]
  [console]
    type = Console
    time_format = plain
  []
[]
```

"plain" is the default option, with which MOOSE simply print the time without any unit.
MOOSE will append "s" for the time if "second" is used.
MOOSE will apply the proper factors for "minute", "hour" and "day" options along with the unit.
MOOSE will print the time in [DTIME format](gnu.org/software/pspp/manual/html_node/Time-and-Date-Formats.html)
with "dtime" option like

```
Time Step 59, time = 1d 03:46:40.0000, dt = 02:17:39.8000
```

This capability can make the console output more intuitive when the times are large.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.07.26` Update

- `HIERARCHIC` and `L2_HIERARCHIC` Finite Element families now support
  prism elements
- Added `NumericVector::l2_norm_diff()`, to enable calculation of
  vector differences without creating a temporary vector.
- Fixes for `MeshedHole` (and thereby [XYDelaunayGenerator.md]
  calculations and error reporting when an input mesh contains both 2D
  and 1D elements.
- Metis and Parmetis are now IsoGeometric-Analysis-aware, and produce
  much better-scaling partitionings of IGA meshes.
- More understandable error reporting if a user's environment mixes
  `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` flags into the same build.

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

### New option for time-stepping past the last time in time sequence steppers

The various time sequence steppers ([TimeSequenceStepper.md], [CSVTimeSequenceStepper.md],
and [ExodusTimeSequenceStepper.md]) compute time step size from a sequence of
time values. Past the final time value, they previously could only make a single
time step directly to the simulation end time. Now an option
`use_last_dt_after_last_t` has been added, which when true, will instead use
the final time step size in the provided sequence past the last time in the sequence.
