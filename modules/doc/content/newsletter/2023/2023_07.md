## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.07.26` Update

- `HIERARCHIC` and `L2_HIERARCHIC` Finite Element families now support
  prism elements
- Added `NumericVector::l2_norm_diff()`, to enable calculation of
  vector differences without creating a temporary vector.
- Fixes for `MeshedHole` (and thereby [XYDelaunayMeshGenerator.md]
  calculations and error reporting when an input mesh contains both 2D
  and 1D elements.
- Metis and Parmetis are now IsoGeometric-Analysis-aware, and produce
  much better-scaling partitionings of IGA meshes.
- More understandable error reporting if a user's environment mixes
  `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` flags into the same build.

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

### New option for time-stepping past the last time in time sequence steppers

The various time sequence steppers ([TimeSequenceStepper.md], [CSVTimeSequenceStepper.md],
and [ExodusTimeSequenceStepper.md]) compute time step size from a sequence of
time values. Past the final time value, they previously could only make a single
time step directly to the simulation end time. Now an option
`use_last_dt_after_last_t` has been added, which when true, will instead use
the final time step size in the provided sequence past the last time in the sequence.
