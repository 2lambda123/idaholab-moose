## MOOSE Improvements

### Support for mesh repartitioning with stateful material properties

We previously could not handle any repartitioning in problems using
stateful material properties, and so MOOSE disabled repartitioning in
This made adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening (AMR/C) and other mesh
modifying simulation types less efficient in parallel.

Now MOOSE will automatically redistribute stateful material property
data as part of any mesh repartitioning step, using the same
serialization APIs that are also used for restarts, for what should be
seamless backwards compatibility.

One note to watch out for: because simulations with stateful material
properties and AMR/C will now enable repartitioning+redistribution by
default, any *other* application code used in a such a simulation
should be either compatible with those operations, or should itself
disable them.
