## MOOSE Improvements

### MultiApp coupling changes

The general field transfers have been added to the framework. They are a re-implementation of existing transfers with additional functionalities,
based on libMesh's [generic projector](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/docs/doxygen/libmesh/classlibMesh_1_1GenericProjector.html). The [documentation for the
base class](MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer.md) explains all the features (siblings transfers, spatial restrictions, higher order variables, etc.) which can be supported. The specific instances implemented are:

- [MultiAppGeneralFieldShapeEvaluationTransfer.md]
- [MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestNodeTransfer.md]
- [MultiAppGeneralFieldUserObjectTransfer.md]


Two additional execution flags (`execute_on`) have been added to MOOSE: `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_BEGIN` and `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_END`. These execution schedules are
executed once at the beginning and the end of the fixed point iterations between multiapps. These flags are related to the fixed point iterations between
the current app and its subapps, *not between the current app and its parent app*. A few notable use for these flags include:

- limiting the transfer of one field to once per time step during a fixed point iteration. The field will not be part of the tight coupling, it will be effectively
  lagged during the fixed point iterations

- performing fixed point iterations with one app and not the other. The multiapp executed on `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_BEGIN/END` will only be executed once,
  while the other multiapp will be executed on each fixed point iteration.


A new parameter has been added to all MultiApps to execute them in a transformed frame of reference: [!param](/MultiApps/FullSolveMultiApp/run_in_position).
This will apply the coordinate transformation (rotations and scaling defined in the MultiApp `[Mesh]` block, and translation from the
[!param](/MultiApps/FullSolveMultiApp/positions) parameter.) to the MultiApps' mesh. Unless a coordinate transformation is also specified in the
parent app's `[Mesh]` block, this parameter makes the child and parent app execute in the same frame of reference.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

The `SimpleFluidProperties` have been further developed to support in more capacity the (specific volume, specific energy)
variable set used in the thermal_hydraulics module.
