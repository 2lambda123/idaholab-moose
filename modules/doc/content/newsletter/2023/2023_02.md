## MOOSE Improvements

### New MultiApp general field transfers

General field transfers have been added to the framework. They are a re-implementation of existing transfers with additional functionalities,
based on libMesh's [generic projector](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/docs/doxygen/libmesh/classlibMesh_1_1GenericProjector.html). The [documentation for the base class](MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer.md)
explains all the features (siblings transfers, spatial restrictions, higher order variables, etc.) which are supported. The specific instances implemented are:

- [MultiAppGeneralFieldShapeEvaluationTransfer.md]
- [MultiAppGeneralFieldNearestNodeTransfer.md]
- [MultiAppGeneralFieldUserObjectTransfer.md]


Two additional execution flags (`execute_on`) have been added to MOOSE: `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_BEGIN` and `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_END`. These execution schedules are
executed once at the beginning and the end of the fixed point iterations between MultiApps, respectively, and are related to the fixed point iterations between
the current app and its subapps, *not between the current app and its parent app*. A few notable uses for these flags include:

- limiting the transfer of one field to once per time step during a fixed point iteration. The field will not be part of the tight coupling and will effectively be
  lagged during the fixed point iterations

- performing fixed point iterations with one app and not the other. The MultiApp executed on `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_BEGIN/END` will only be executed once,
  while the other MultiApp will be executed on each fixed point iteration.

### New parameter: transform a MultiApp frame of reference

A new parameter has been added to all MultiApps to execute them in a transformed frame of reference: [!param](/MultiApps/FullSolveMultiApp/run_in_position).
This will apply the coordinate transformation (rotations and scaling defined in the MultiApp `[Mesh]` block, and translation from the
[!param](/MultiApps/FullSolveMultiApp/positions) parameter) to the MultiApps' mesh. Unless a coordinate transformation is also specified in the
parent app's `[Mesh]` block, this parameter makes the child and parent app execute in the same frame of reference.

### Post-processor added to query solid properties

[ThermalSolidPropertiesPostprocessor.md] was added to the
[solid properties module](modules/solid_properties/index.md), which allows
users to query a given property from a [ThermalSolidProperties.md] object
at a temperature given by a post-processor value.

### Improved the ability to mark the converged solution invalid

We have improved the recently-added capability that allows a user to [mark a solution as "invalid"](source/problems/SolutionInvalidity.md). Once marked invalid, the system allows output of which object triggered the invalidity as well as how many times the warning occurs. An invalid solution means that the solution somehow does not satisfy requirements, such as a value being out of the bounds of a correlation.  Solutions are allowed to be invalid *during* the nonlinear solve - but are not allowed to be invalid once it converges. A "converged" solution that is marked as invalid will cause MOOSE to behave as if the solution did NOT converge - including cutting back timesteps, etc. A macro, `flagInvalidSolution`, is provided to declare a solution as "invalid". The macro allows for a user-defined short description of the object (optional) and a message to describe the invalidity.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- `SimpleFluidProperties` has been further developed to better support the (specific volume, specific energy)
  variable set used in the thermal_hydraulics module.
