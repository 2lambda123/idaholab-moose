### Projected stateful material properties

The [ProjectedStatefulMaterialStorage](/ProjectedStatefulMaterialStorage/index.md)
action system has been added to MOOSE. The action allows users to specify material
properties that will be (componentwise) projected a finite element function basis
to store the old and older state of the properties.

This is an *alternative* way of keeping old material property state, which permits
interpolation at new or changing quadrature point locations (encountered - for
example - with mortar contact or adaptivity). Both nodal as well as elemental basis
functions can be used for the projection. In the case of nodal (Lagrange) functions
nodal patch recovery will be used to compute the nodal degrees of freedom.
