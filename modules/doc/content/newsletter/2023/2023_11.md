## MOOSE Improvements

### Coordinate transformations during transfers between applications

General coordinate transformations between applications have been implemented in the
[MultiAppGeneralField](MultiAppGeneralFieldTransfer.md)-derived transfers. This enables transfers between
from RZ to XYZ geometries, for example, or accounting for arbitrary rotations (defined in the `[Mesh]` blocks)
when transferring between applications.
