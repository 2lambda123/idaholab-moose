## MOOSE Improvements

### Positions system

A new system was implemented in MOOSE. [Positions](syntax/Positions/index.md) are used to keep track
of the locations of objects during MOOSE-based simulations.
By default, they are updated when the mesh changes and on every execution. They can be used to spawn
`MultiApps` distributed at the positions stored in the `Positions` object.
Several `Positions` were implemented to help kickstart the use of the system:

- [InputPositions.md]
- [FilePositions.md]
- [ReporterPositions.md]
- [MultiAppPositions.md]
- [ElementCentroidPositions.md]
- [ElementGroupCentroidPositions.md]
