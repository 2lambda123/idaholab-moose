## MOOSE Improvements

### Positions system

A new system was implemented in MOOSE. [Positions](framework:syntax/Positions/index.md) are used to keep track
of the locations of objects during MOOSE-based simulations.
By default, they are updated when the mesh changes and on every execution. They can be used to spawn
`MultiApps` distributed at the positions stored in the `Positions` object.
Several `Positions` were implemented to help kickstart the use of the system:

- [framework:InputPositions.md]
- [framework:FilePositions.md]
- [framework:ReporterPositions.md]
- [framework:MultiAppPositions.md]
- [framework:ElementCentroidPositions.md]
- [framework:ElementGroupCentroidPositions.md]

### Possibility to combine TimeSteppers

The time stepper system in MOOSE has been improved. A new [`[TimeSteppers]`](framework:TimeSteppers/index.md) block has been introduced to replace the functionality of the current `[TimeStepper]` block. The new system keeps the features of `[TimeStepper]` and also supports composing multiple time steppers to compute the time step size. Users can still use `[TimeStepper]` for now, but in the future this block will be deprecated.

When more than one time stepper is provided, the new time stepper system will automatically compute the minimum time step among all the input time steppers as the time step size to use for that application. The new time stepper system also provides a [!param](/Executioner/TimeSteppers/lower_bound) parameter to further control the time stepper size (e.g. enable growth driven by a single time stepper). This system is controllable via the [Controls](framework:syntax/Controls/index.md) system. The user can turn on/off the provided time steppers to control the usage of time steppers ; for example, one could make time stepper(s) only active [during a certain time period](framework:TimePeriod.md).

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

### Added function average post-processors

The post-processors [framework:FunctionElementAverage.md] and [framework:FunctionSideAverage.md]
were added, which compute the average of a function over blocks and boundaries,
respectively.
