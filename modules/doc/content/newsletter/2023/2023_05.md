## MOOSE Improvements

### Positions system

A new system was implemented in MOOSE. [Positions](syntax/Positions/index.md) are used to keep track
of the locations of objects during MOOSE-based simulations.
By default, they are updated when the mesh changes and on every execution. They can be used to spawn
`MultiApps` distributed at the positions stored in the `Positions` object.
Several `Positions` were implemented to help kickstart the use of the system:

- [InputPositions.md]
- [FilePositions.md]
- [ReporterPositions.md]
- [MultiAppPositions.md]
- [ElementCentroidPositions.md]
- [ElementGroupCentroidPositions.md]

### TimeStepper System

The time stepper system in MOOSE has been improved. We introduce a new [TimeSteppers](TimeSteppers/index.md) block to replace the current `[TimeStepper]` block. The new `[TimeSteppers]` keeps the features of `[TimeStepper]` and also supports the composed time step size with multiple time steps inputs. The users can still use `[TimeStepper]`, but in the future this block will be deprecated.

When more than one time steppers are provided, the time stepper system will automatically select the minimum time step among all the input time steppers as the output time step size. The time stepper system also provides a [!param](/Executioner/TimeSteppers/lower_bound) to further control the time stepper size (e.g. enable growth driven by a single time stepper). This system is controllable via [Controls](syntax/Controls/index.md) block. The user can turn on/off the time steppers to control the usage of time steppers like make time stepper(s) only active [at certain time period](TimePeriod.md).
