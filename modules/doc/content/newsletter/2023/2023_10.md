## MOOSE Improvements

### Input file includes

The following syntax can now be used to include other input files in an input file:

```
!include path/to/input.i
```

See [Includes](input_syntax.md) for more information.

### Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian coupling FE and FV

In [PR 25574](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/25574) we demonstrated an
Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) laser melt pool simulation in which fluid velocity,
pressure, and temperature were discretized using finite volumes while
the mesh displacement field was discretized using finite elements. This required
a few important developments in MOOSE:

- Addition of `NodeArg` overloads to the MOOSE functor (on-the-fly evaluation)
  system. This allows coupling the finite volume velocity variables into the Dirichlet
  boundary condition that displaces the surface in the ALE simulation
- Implementation of "finite-volume" functor methods for finite element variables
  for coupling finite element variables into the finite volume discretization
  (`ElemArg`, `FaceArg`)
- Allowing finite volume discretizations to operate on a displaced mesh

### Hybrid CG-DG formulation for Navier-Stokes

We merged [PR 23986](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/23986) which
demonstrates a hybrid-method for discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations in
which the pressure uses a continuous Galerkin discretization while the velocity
components use a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. This formulation is
intrinsically
[LBB stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyzhenskaya%E2%80%93Babu%C5%A1ka%E2%80%93Brezzi_condition)
and allows a natural upwind stabilization for momentum advection. For more
information regarding the method, please see [hcgdgfe.md].
