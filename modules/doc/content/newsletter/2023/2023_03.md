## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.03.02` Update

- Improvements to mesh redistribution

  - `ReplicatedMesh` and serialized `DistributedMesh` objects now also
    call `GhostingFunctor::redistribute()` callbacks (enabling
    communication of distributed data like MOOSE stateful materials on
    top of replicated mesh data).
  - GhostingFunctor code now supports (in deprecated builds) less
    strict behavior from subclasses.
  - Redundant calls to `redistribute()` in special cases have been
    combined.
  - `scatter_constraints()` now uses a more optimal data structure.
  - `send_coarse_ghosts()` and `redistribute()` now use the NBX
    parallel synchronization algorithm.  These had been the last two
    distributed algorithms in libMesh using older less-scalable
    MPI techniques.
  - Bug fix: in some use cases (including MOOSE applications using
    mesh refinement) libMesh could fail to properly synchronize
    changing nodeset definitions

- Side boundary ids now be set on child elements, not just coarse mesh
  elements, allowing for adaptive refinement of sidesets.
- Clearer error messages are now printed when a `parallel_only`
  assertion is failed.
- `subdomain_id` has been added to output when printing `Elem` info.
- `send_list` data is now properly prepared in all use cases.  This
  fixes Geometric MultiGrid compatibility with PETSc 3.18, and may
  give slight performance improvements elsewhere.
- A `System::has_constraint_object()` query API has been added.
- Bug fixes for msys2 / Windows builds, TIMPI `set_union` of maps with
  inconsistent values assigned to the same key, packed-range
  communication of pairs with fixed-size data and padding bytes.

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- A [VectorPostprocessor parallel bug identified by ANL researchers](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/23514), was fixed by [defaulting to asking for parallel synchronized VPP values](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/23588).
