## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

### `2023.09.06` Update

- NetCDF upgrade to 4.9.2, now incorporating NetCDF via a git submodule
- p-refinement can now be selectively disabled and reenabled on a
  per-variable-group basis
- New error indicator for Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM)
  reduced-basis approximations
- `Elem::quality(ASPECT_RATIO)` is now defined for all element types
- Added option to use absolute instead of relative tolerances in
  linear solvers
- Added the capability to "upgrade" a vector's ghosting and/or
  projection settings in subsequent `System::add_vector()` calls
- Added `MeshRefinement::allow_unrefined_patches()` option
- Refactored iterator declarations and added more range methods in
  `MeshBase`: every filtered iterator that could be previously
  accessed with a `...begin()` and `...end()` method now also has a
  `...range()` method suitable for range-based for loops
- Better PETSc versioning macros for use with pre-release PETSc
  commits
- Build system now sets `CFLAGS_OPT`, etc. environment variables, not
  just `CXXFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` versions
- Many more unit tests for ExodusII I/O and for element refinement
  APIs
- Assorted fixes 
  - Fixed Exodus I/O of side sets on 2D triangles embedded in 3D
    space
  - Fixed Nemesis dimension variable output
  - Fixed Nedelec one `FE` compatibility with `Tri7` and `Tet14`
    geometric elements
  - Fixed multiple issues with mesh refinement on meshes with certain
    types of infinite elements
  - Fixed no-parameters case and improved print statements in EIM code
  - Fixed typos in code comments
  - Minor fixes in vector FE example programs
- Assorted optimizations
  - an unnecessary pointer-indirection layer has been removed from
    `DiffContext`
  - local matrix allocation in `DiffContext` objects is now optional
  - minor optimizations have been made to Hilbert-curve global
    indexing calculations
