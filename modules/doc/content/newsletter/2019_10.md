## Collaborative Computing Center

We move to our new location in early October, the Collaborative Computing Center. The location
includes open workspace for the software teams, meeting rooms, and lots of room for collaboration.
There will also be a new supercomputer being installed at the end of the year with approximately
100,000 cores. All of the changes will help INL continue to grow as a leader in computational
software and hardware.


## Google Search

Our main website was updated to include a gallery of examples as well as a Google based search,
which will provide better search results for our users.


## ExplicitSSPRungeKutta Time Integrator

The time integrator `ExplicitSSPRungeKutta` was created, which implements
strong-stability-preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta methods of orders 1, 2, and 3.
This time integrator was modeled in the fashion of `ActuallyExplicitEuler`,
i.e., it bypasses the nonlinear solver, gives options for mass matrix
computation and inversion, and does not require the user to modify the
`implicit` parameter of residual objects.
