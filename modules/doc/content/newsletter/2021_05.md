## Porous media incompressible flow capabilities

We added support for solving the porous flow incompressible Navier Stokes equations to the
`navier_stokes` module. These include mass, momentum and energy conservation for the fluid phase.
Some helpful additional kernels for the solid energy conservation equation, such as to handle the
time derivative and the heat convection terms, are also included.

## Weighted Gap Mortar Mechanical Contact Implementation

We have implemented a variationally consistent discretization scheme for the
zero-penetration mechanical contact constraints. Interested readers may refer to
the associated [issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/16961) and
[pull request](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/17189).

## Finite volume interface kernels

We have added interface kernels for finite volume physics. Some use cases for
these interface kernels are: enforcing solution continuity across an interface and
enforcing flux continuity when material properties must have different names on
different subdomains for ghosting reasons.

## Post-processors Usable in Initial Conditions

We added [/PostprocessorInterface.md] to initial conditions. Post-processor
values can now be retrieved using `getPostprocessorValue()` and `getPostprocessorValueByName()`,
and these post-processors will be executed before the initial condition as long
as their `execute_on` parameters include `INITIAL`.

## SQA Updates

We have updated the document governing our software quality practices. The changes have resulted
in a few more required SQA documents.

- [sqa/moose_sll.md]
- [sqa/framework_cci.md]
- [sqa/framework_scs.md]

## Proportional Integral Derivative controller

We added a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller to the Control system. This is
helpful for basic tuning / optimization tasks, where some parameters of the simulation have
to evolve to match a target value.

## Nesting made easier in MeshGenerator subclasses

The new MeshGenerator::addMeshSubgenerator() API simplifies the
process of creating a C++ subclass of MeshGenerator with a constructor
which can instantiate other MeshGenerator classes as "subgenerators",
on the fly, specifying subgenerator arguments programmatically.  At
execution time the subgenerators are executed, respecting any required
dependency ordering, and the new subclass then has access to the
generated meshes (either from an ab initio generator or via a chain of
subgenerator) to further modify and/or combine to produce its own
generated mesh.

## libMesh-level changes

- The NEDELEC\_ONE vector-valued space now supports Tet10 elements
- Added accessors to easily get global sets of boundary or subdomain ids
- User vectors' parallel type is now stored, for more robust restarts
- MetaPhysicL types can now be compatibly nested in Eigen types
- Enabled std::move of data in TIMPI parallel\_sync.h push and pull
- Fixes for wider PETSc version compatibility
- Bugfix in Elem::is\_child\_on\_edge
- Memory leak fix in PetscMatrix::matrix\_matrix\_mult
- Configure option fix for --enable\_petsc\_required

## Bug Fixes and Minor Improvements

- Increased documentation for the Navier Stokes module, and a few MOOSE postprocessors
  and auxiliary kernels
