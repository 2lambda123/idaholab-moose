# MOOSE News (March 2019)

## MOOSEDocs LaTeX Support

Support for PDF output (via pdflatex) was added to MOOSEDocs, this capability includes support for
latex output to all MOOSEDocs extensions. This capability is still in the early stages of
development, but if you are ambitious and would like to test out the capability the following will
demonstrate the tool.

```bash
cd ~/projects/moose/test
make -j12
cd ~/projects/moose/python/MooseDocs/test
./moosedocs.py build --config latex.yml
open output/latex/main.pdf # MacOS only
```

## AD Vector Variable Coupling

Support was added to the automatic differentiation system in support of coupling to vector variables
via the `adCoupledVectorValue` and `adCoupledVectorGradient` functions within the ADKernel objects.

## AD Fluid Properties

Support was added to the fluid properties system for automatic differentiation - currently
SinglePhaseFluidProperties only.  To use it, call the appropriate functions while passing in
ADReal values - e.g.:

```c++
// assume rho is an AD nonlinear variable:
ADReal specific_vol = 1 / rho;

// assume rhoE, and rhou are AD nonlinear variables:
ADReal u = rhou/rho;
ADReal specific_internal_energy = rhoE / rho - u*u/2;
ADReal pressure = _fluid_prop_object.p_from_v_e(specific_vol, specific_internal_energy);
```
