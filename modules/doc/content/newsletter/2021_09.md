## libMesh-level changes

- Major bugfix: FE mapping calculations previously could have up to
  approximately 1e-6 relative error on slightly perturbed meshes.
  Fixing this invalidated dozens of gold test files, some with up to
  1e-4 relative error in their solutions!
- Fix/optimization for problems with adjoint Dirichlet conditions
- Optional Exodus v8.11 support
- Elem::centroid() implementation deprecated, replaced by
  true\_centroid() for accuracy or vertex\_average() for speed.
- Adaptive Mesh Refinement support for meshes with Infinite Elements
- TIMPI and MetaPhysicL update, including specializations for
  communication of Automatic Differentiation types and their
  dependencies
- Minor bug + compatibility fixes, optimizations

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- In [NestedSolve.md], the method `getState()` was added to get the state of the
  solve. This allows the user to check if the solve converged, or if it did
  converged, by what criteria.
