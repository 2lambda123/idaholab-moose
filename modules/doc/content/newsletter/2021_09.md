## MOOSE Improvements

### Perf Graph Live

The `PerfGraph` utility has been augmented with a "live" capability.
This can be viewed as a joining together of `PerfGraph` and
`ConsoleTimedPrint`.  This allows the `PerfGraph` to print out status
during the execution of a program, including printing about what's
happening, how long sections of code took to run, and how much memory
each section added.

!alert warning
To make this possible changes to `Console` were necessary.  You *must* now utilize a `std::endl` or `std::flush` at the end of your console output for it to appear!

More information can be found in the [PerfGraph.md] documentation.

Here is an example of the new capability during the setup of a large problem:

## libMesh-level changes

- Major bugfix: FE mapping calculations previously could have up to
  approximately 1e-6 relative error on slightly perturbed meshes.
  Fixing this invalidated dozens of gold test files, some with up to
  1e-4 relative error in their solutions!
- Fix/optimization for problems with adjoint Dirichlet conditions
- Optional Exodus v8.11 support
- Elem::centroid() implementation deprecated, replaced by
  true\_centroid() for accuracy or vertex\_average() for speed.
- Adaptive Mesh Refinement support for meshes with Infinite Elements
- TIMPI and MetaPhysicL update, including specializations for
  communication of Automatic Differentiation types and their
  dependencies
- Minor bug + compatibility fixes, optimizations

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- In [NestedSolve.md], the method `getState()` was added to get the state of the
  solve. This allows the user to check if the solve converged, or if it did
  converged, by what criteria.
