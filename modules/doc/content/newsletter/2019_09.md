## SQA Documentation

Completing documentation for NQA-1 has been a primary focus over the past month, if you are
interested in seeing the results of this labor please visit [sqa/index.md exact=True].

## MeshGenerators and MeshModifiers

The MeshModifiers have been officially deprecated. All of the existing MeshModifiers have equivalent
MeshGenerators that can be used to achieve the same behavior. Many applications are using modifiers so
this is a big impact. Everyone should be moving to the generator system in the next month or two so
that we can remove the old system. There will be additional enhancements that enable better restart
capabilities before the old MeshModifiers system is removed.

### New MeshModifier Syntax

We have streamlined the syntax for MeshModifiers. Rather than having separate top level blocks for
MeshModifiers, we are moving the generators to subblocks under the `[Mesh]` block. This makes sense
logically because you might use several generators to build up a mesh so there's little need for
a separate `[Mesh]` block. As a convenience you don't need to explicitly set the `MeshGeneratorMesh`
type when using the new syntax. If you have any generators at all, the mesh type is assumed to be
the `MeshGeneratorMesh` (e.g. the final mesh resulting from processing all of the generators).

Here's an example of how to use the new syntax to build up a mesh:

```
[Mesh]
  [file_reader]
    type = FileMeshGenerator
    file = twoblocks.e
  []

  [block_1]
    type = SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator
    input = file_reader # Establishes the dependency on the reader
    block = 'left'
    new_boundary = 'hull_1'
  []

  [block_2]
    type = SideSetsAroundSubdomainGenerator
    input = block_1 # dependency on the first sideset creator
    block = 'right'
    new_boundary = 'hull_2'
  []
[]
```
