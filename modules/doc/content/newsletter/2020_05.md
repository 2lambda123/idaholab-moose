## Stochastic Tools

1. The surrogate system within the stochastic tools modules was enhanced to support the creation
   of trainer and evaluation objects. This includes the ability to store and load arbitrary training
   data for both in memory evaluation or loading from a file.
1. The documentation for the stochastic tools module was improved to include more examples, including
   using the new train/evaluate object structure, see [modules/stochastic_tools/index.md].

## Python parameters package

A new python package for input parameters was created in the python directory. This new package is
thoroughly tested and will replace the various other parameter systems within the MOOSE python tools
in the near future. Please consider using this new package if you are creating python tools in an
application and desire a parameter system.

## Finite Volumes

Experimental support for solving PDEs using the finite volume method has been added to MOOSE.

## Conda Environment Installation

The traditional moose-environment packages have been replaced with conda-packages, see [installation/conda.md].
