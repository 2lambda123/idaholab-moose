## Support Ended for PETSc 3.5

Full support for PETSc 3.5 has ended, as the few remaining references to 3.5
[have been removed from MOOSE](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/22829). If using PETSc 3.5,
please consider updating to the current supported release (3.16.6) or the alternate tested release
(3.11.4) using either of the `update_and_rebuild_petsc` scripts.
