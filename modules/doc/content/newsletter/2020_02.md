# MOOSE Newsletter (Febuary 2020)

## Python 2 Support Removed

All MOOSE utilities written in python (e.g., peacock, run_tests, and MOOSEDocs) now require python
3.6 or greater. If you still have python 2 you can update by following the [getting_started/index.md]
instructions.

## SQA and MOOSEDocs

We have added capability and improved the performance of MOOSEDocs in support of our ongoing
effort to implement and document our development processes to an NQA-1 level standard. Mainly, we
have added a connection from the requirements to the CIVET testing results, see [framework_rtm.md].

## CSV Validation Tester

A new tester is now available for users doing validation work.  Currently it can only test steady-state
results, but transient support is planned in near future.  The tester computes mean and standard
deviation of the error between the measured and computed values and users can setup tolerances on
both values, see more at [CSVValidationTester.md].
