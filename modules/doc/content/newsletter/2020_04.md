## SoftwareX Paper Published

The new MOOSE paper was published in SoftwareX: [MOOSE: Enabling massively parallel multiphysics simulation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100430).

## Update `validParams`

The framework and all modules have been updated to use a static function for `validParams`. Please
update your applications to use the new static function and see
[#14135](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/14135) see the changes in MOOSE. To update
application perform the following steps.

1. In the header (.h) file, +remove the class forward declaration and declaration of the template
   specialization+ of `validParams`.

   ```C++
   // Forward Declarations
   class MyCustomObject;

   template <>
   InputParameters validParams<MyCustomObject>();
   ```

2. In the header (.h) file, +add a static member function for `validParams` in the class definition+.

   ```
   class MyCustomObject : public AuxKernel
   {
   public:
     static InputParameters validParams();
   ```

3. In the source (.C) file, the definition of the template specialization,

   ```C++
   InputParameters
   validParams<MyCustomObject>()
   {
     InputParameters params = validParams<AuxKernel>();
     return params;
   }
   ```

   should be updated to define the static member function as follows. Be sure to update the
   call to the parent class `validParams` function to use the static version as well.

   ```C++
   InputParameters
   MyCustomObject::validParams()
   {
     InputParameters params = AuxKernel::validParams();
     return params;
   }
   ```

## ImageFunction Documentation

The [ImageFunction.md] documentation was moved from the old wiki!

## Stochastic Tools Module

- Added a [LatinHypercubeSampler.md]
- Generalized [SobolSampler.md] to operate with arbitrary sampling schemes
- [PolynomialChaos.md] surrogate modeling now includes vector postprocessors for computing [statistical moments](PolynomialChaosStatistics.md), [local sensitivity](PolynomialChaosLocalSensitivity.md), and [global sensitivity](PolynomialChaosSobolStatistics.md)
- [QuadratureSampler.md] now includes sparse grid techniques including Gauss-Smolyak and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature grids.
