## "moosetools" Repository Removed

The effort to extract the python tools from MOOSE into a more generic set of tools
has been halted. If the need for this effort changes it may be considered again
in the future.

## MOOSE Improvements and New Features

### Reactor Module

A new module called `Reactor` [has been introduced in MOOSE](reactor/index.md)
to enhance MOOSE's mesh generation capabilities for nuclear reactor designs,
specifically hexagonal pins, assemblies, and cores.

The currently available capability allows an analyst to build a hexagonal pin,
ducted assembly, and core using a series of new MeshGenerators. [SimpleHexagonGenerator.md]
quickly builds a homogenized hexagonal pin or assembly for coarse mesh representation.
[PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.md] builds heterogeneous pin cells with optional
ducts. This MeshGenerator is generalized for regular polygon pin cells with any
number of sides (3=triangle, 4=Cartesian, .. 6=hexagon). Azimuthal mesh discretization
may vary by polygon side. [PatternedHexMeshGenerator.md] patterns pin cells into an
assembly and optionally adds ducted regions. It can also be used to pattern assemblies
into a core. The capabilities in this module allows a reactor analyst to avoid the
use of external, licensed meshing tools and streamlines the workflow significantly
for MOOSE-based reactor physics analysis, lowering the barrier to entry for users.
Special attention was paid to allow the user to assign block names, IDs and external
boundary names and IDs if desired.

Additional functionality is forthcoming in the next few weeks to support static
and rotating control drum geometry, automated extra element integer ID assignments
called Reporting IDs on the mesh to identify and track pins, assemblies, planes,
and depletion zones, a triangular meshing capability for meshing core peripheries,
and a Reactor Geometry Mesh Builder which uses the new SubMeshGenerator capability
in MOOSE to streamline inputs for Cartesian or hexagonal pins, assemblies and cores
and automatically use ID tracking for regions as well as apply material assignments
to the mesh.

The Reactor module capabilities (current and forthcoming) are discussed in a
[recent report](https://doi.org/10.2172/1821454). This module was developed with
funding from the DOE-NEAMS Multiphysics Technical Area to support advanced reactor
analysis with MOOSE-based applications. For additional information on upcoming
capabilities in this module, please contact Emily Shemon (eshemon@anl.gov).
