## "moosetools" Repository Removed

The effort to extract the python tools from MOOSE into a more generic set of tools
has been halted. If the need for this effort changes it may be considered again
in the future.

## Reactor Module

A new module called `Reactor` [has been introduced in MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/reactor/index.html) to enhance MOOSE's mesh generation capabilities for nuclear reactor designs, specifically hexagonal pins, assemblies, and cores. 

The currently available capability allows an analyst to build a hexagonal pin, ducted assembly, and core using a series of new meshgenerators. `SimpleHexagonGenerator` quickly builds a homogenized hexagonal pin or assembly for coarse mesh representation. `PolygonConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` builds heterogeneous pin cells with optional ducts. This meshgenerator is generalized for regular polygon pin cells with any number of sides (3=triangle, 4=Cartesian, .. 6=hexagon). Azimuthal mesh discretization may vary by polygon side. `PatternedHexMeshGenerator` patterns pin cells into an assembly and optionally adds ducted regions. It can also be used to pattern assemblies into a core. The capabilities in this module allows a reactor analyst to avoid the use of external, licensed meshing tools and streamlines the workflow significantly for MOOSE-based reactor physics analysis, lowering the barrier to entry for users. Special attention was paid to allow the user to assign block names, IDs and external boundary names and IDs if desired.

Additional functionality is forthcoming in the next few weeks to support static and rotating control drum geometry, automated extra element integer id assignments called Reporting IDs on the mesh to identify and track pins, assemblies, planes, and depletion zones, a triangular meshing capability for meshing core peripheries, and a Reactor Geometry Mesh Builder which uses the new submeshgenerator capability in MOOSE to streamline inputs for Cartesian or hexagonal pins, assemblies and cores and automatically use ID tracking for regions as well as apply material assignments to the mesh. 

The Reactor module capabilities (current and forthcoming) are discussed in a [recent report](https://doi.org/10.2172/1821454). This module was developed with funding from the DOE-NEAMS Multiphysics Technical Area to support advanced reactor analysis with MOOSE-based applications.
