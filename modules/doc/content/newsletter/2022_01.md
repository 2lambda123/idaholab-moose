## Conda MPICH Updated to 3.4.2

To gain enhanced support for newer platform architectures alongside various bug
fixes and enhancements, the `moose-mpich` package was updated to MPICH 3.4.2
([released May 2021](https://www.mpich.org/2021/05/28/mpich-3-4-2-released/)).
This update can be obtained by activating the conda MOOSE environment and performing:

at least the following:

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- A boolean parameter `extrap` was added to [PiecewiseLinear.md], which when set
  to `true` specifies that extrapolation occurs when the sample is outside of the
  provided abscissa values, instead of using the nearest ordinate value.
