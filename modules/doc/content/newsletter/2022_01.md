## Conda MPICH Updated to 3.4.2

To gain enhanced support for newer platform architectures alongside various bug
fixes and enhancements, the `moose-mpich` package was updated to MPICH 3.4.2
([released May 2021](https://www.mpich.org/2021/05/28/mpich-3-4-2-released/)).
This update can be obtained by activating the conda MOOSE environment and performing:

```
conda update --all
```

where the appropriate versions and build numbers in the update output should be
at least the following:

```
Package                  Version            Build
=====================================================
moose-libmesh            2021.12.15         build_1
moose-libmesh-vtk        9.1.0              build_1
moose-mpich              3.4.2              build_0
moose-petsc              3.15.1             build_4
```

## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

- Make `CompareDofObjectsByID` available to all. This is useful for building sets
  of node and element pointers that have more deterministic ordering than if the
  set was ordered based on the pointer addresses
- Make use of `std::condition_variable` for `_get_array`. Eliminates helgrind
  errors during multi-thread access to `PetscVector::get`
- Update to TIMPI 1.8.2
- Nanoflann update to 1.4.1
- Use get_unique_tag() for a few more MessageTags
- Remove caching from FE<CLOUGH>
- Higher precision when printing assert failures
- resolve warning of expectedly unbinned entries.
- Clear input data structure before using
- Don't unnecessarily compute the Jacobian for ComputeResidualandJacobian. This
  optimization will likely be leveraged in MOOSE in order to compute the residual
  and Jacobian simultaneously, avoiding duplicate variable and material property
  reinitialization.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Enhancements

- A boolean parameter `extrap` was added to [PiecewiseLinear.md], which when set
  to `true` specifies that extrapolation occurs when the sample is outside of the
  provided abscissa values, instead of using the nearest ordinate value.
