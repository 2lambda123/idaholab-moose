## MOOSE Improvements

### PeripheralTriangleMeshGenerator

A new mesh generator available in the MOOSE reactors module, the
[PeripheralTriangleMeshGenerator.md], allows users to take an arbitrary
2-D input mesh (typically a reactor core) and
automatically add a triangulation of the area in between the input
mesh boundary and a circular periphery.  For thick peripheries,
element size within that area can be reduced by user-specified
parameters defining extra circles of element vertices to add.  The
output mesh may then be passed to other generators for further
extension, extrusion to 3-D, etc.

[Figure 1](#triangle_steiner) shows an example triangulation around an existing core mesh.
