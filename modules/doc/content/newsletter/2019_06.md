## PorousFlow: Reduction of Numerical Diffusion

A new type of numerical stabilization has been added to PorousFlow to complement the existing "full upwind" and "no stabilization" choices.  The aim is to reduce numerical diffusion.  The code is based on the theoretical work of Kuzmin and Turek.  Users are strongly encouraged to experiment with this new feature so we can collectively learn the strengths and weaknesses in real simulations.  Only [minor changes to input files](porous_flow/kt.md) are needed to activate the new stabilization.  The numerical stabilization [lead page](porous_flow/stabilization.md) lists pros and cons of various stabilization schemes and provides links to pages that explain and quantify numerical diffusion.

## Array variable

We added in MOOSE a new capability, namely [array variable](ArrayMooseVariable.md).
A set of new objects making use of it including array kernels, boundary conditions, etc. was also added.
An array variable is define as a set of standard field variables with the same finite element family and order.
Each standard variable of an array variable is referred to as a component of the array variable.
An array variable can be added as

!listing tests/kernels/array_kernels/array_diffusion_test.i block=Variables

by specifying the number of components with parmaeter *component*.
The default value of the parameter is one, meaning that the variable is either a standard variable or a vector variable depending on the family.

An array kernel is a MOOSE kernel operating on an array variable and assembles the residuals and Jacobians for all the components of the array variable.
A sample array kernel can be found at [ArrayDiffusion.md].
Similarly as array kernel, we have array initial conditions, array boundary conditions, array DG kernels, array interface kernels, array constraints, etc.
A complete input file with an array variable can be found [array_diffusion_test.i].
Array variables can be coupled into standard kernels and vice versa as showed in [array_diffusion_reaction_coupling.i] and [array_diffusion_reaction_other_coupling.i]

The purpose of having array variables is to reduce the number of kernels, BCs, etc. when the number of components of an array variable is large (potentially hundreds or thousands) and to avoid duplicated operations otherwise with lots of standard kernels.
Array variable can be useful for radiation transport where an extra independent direction variable can result into large number of standard variables.

A list of MOOSE objects using array variables:

- [ArrayDiffusion.md]
- [ArrayReaction.md]
- [ArrayDirichletBC.md]
- [ArrayPenaltyDirichletBC.md]
- [ArrayVacuumBC.md]
- [ArrayDGDiffusion.md]
- [ArrayConstantIC.md]
- [ArrayFunctionIC.md]
- [ArrayVariableComponent.md]
- [ElementIntegralArrayVariablePostprocessor.md]

Application developers can derive new array kernels, boundary conditions, DG kernels, initial conditions with them as templates.
Array interface kernels, auxiliary kernels, etc. can be added in the future.

Two simple generic constant materials were also added that can be used in array arithmetic operations:

- [GenericConstantArray.md]
- [GenericConstant2DArray.md]
