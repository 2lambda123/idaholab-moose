## MOOSE Conda Packages Now Compatible with Xcode Newer Than 12.4, MacOS Monterey

Conda package updates for `moose-mpich`, `moose-petsc`, and `moose-libmesh` were
merged in [#19230](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/19230), and they enable
full MacOS Big Sur compatibility for previously unsupported Xcode and Command Line
Tools versions 12.5, 13, and 13.1. This update also enables support for MacOS Monterey.
The Clang compiler has also been updated to 12.0.1.

!alert! note title=Intel Macs Only
This update only applies to Intel Macs. Official M1 Apple Silicon support is on
the way! Track the MOOSE issue [#18954](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/18954)
if interested in new developments.

To download the new packages, please activate your MOOSE conda environment and
perform the following command:

```
conda update --all
```

where the appropriate versions and build in the update output should be:

```
Package                  Version            Build
=====================================================
moose-libmesh            2021.10.27         build_1
moose-mpich              3.3.2              build_8
moose-petsc              3.15.1             build_3
```

If any issues with the new packages are experienced, please open a new
[Discussions post](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions)!

## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

- Changes to dual shape function initialization to enable edge
  dropping and 3D mortar problems.
- Refactored autoconf compiler option selection, to allow for testing
  of submodules with stricter compiler settings.
- Reduced Basis support for Empirical Interpolation Method
  incorporation of integral terms on element sides.
- API support for selecting SVD as a preconditioner type
- Improvements to the ``calculator'' app, for visualizing projections
  of parsed functions on meshes (and, optionally, pre-existing
  solutions), to allow it to optionally noutput numeric integrals
  instead.
- Fix (or at least workaround for a compiler bug) for broken JIT
  parsed function compilation on Apple M1 compilers. 
- Fix for broken TIMPI communication of standard library structured
  classes of large strings.
- Fix for potential leak of TIMPI derived data types, causing valgrind
  errors in some use cases.
- Assorted minor bugfixes: for Exodus IGA reads of files with multiple
  element blocks, for Exodus IGA files with homogeneous (implicit)
  element weights, for element quality calculations on infinite hexes,
  and for Xdr header writes and a potentially uninitialized Xdr
  version variable.
