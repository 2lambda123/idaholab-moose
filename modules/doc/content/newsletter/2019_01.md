# MOOSE Newsletter (January 2019)

As the first newsletter of the year, following a busy 2018 and the holiday break, this issue will
focus not on what has been done, but what we are working toward during 2019.

## MOOSEDocs

The development of the documentation system will continue in 2019, with three major additions planned
for 2019. First, the ability to create PDF will be completed in the first quarter of the year. The
system will use LaTeX to generate the PDF, including the ability to compile all the pages of the
website into a single document. Second, the ability to create presentations from markdown, this
system will likely rely on [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com). Third, auto formatting is planned
for the markdown files, this will allow for text to be automatically wrapped and spaced uniformly
within the markdown files (i.e., clang-format for markdown).

Most importantly, the MOOSEDocs system is now maturing and core system level work should be winding
down during this year. Hopefully, this will allowed increase focus on writing more documentation
including the creation of new tutorials and examples.

## Chigger

The visualization scripting tool chigger, "the mite to replace EnSight," will undergo a major
overhaul during 2019. The new version will have two significant improvements: (1) it will include
the ability to automatically interpolate between timesteps, including across timesteps with
mesh adaptivity; (2) an interactive, command-line interface will be created to allow for all
components of the visualization to be modified without closing the window.
