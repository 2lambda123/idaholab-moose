## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.08.05` Update
- Support reading/writing extra node integers and extra element
  integers in XDR and XDA files.
- Support inverted 1D element orientations when reconstructing mesh
  neighbors.
- `--deny_re` command line option for unit test driver, to allow more
  options for running subsets of the full unit test suite.
- `Eigen` upgrade to 3.4.0; now via a git submodule to make future
  upgrades easier and more efficient.
- More internal use of smart pointers for memory management and
  exception safety.
- `MetaPhysicL` update to 1.4.0, fixing an intermittent bug in the test
  suite
- `TIMPI` update to 1.8.5, giving better compiler error messages for
  certain user errors, more parallel unit testing, and warning fixes
  for new compilers.
- Additional features for `Poly2TriTriangulator`, including
  triangulation of id-defined subsets of outer boundaries, and
  verification of boundary non-intersection.
- New `TriangulatorInterface::Hole::contains()` API
- Improved `DistributedMesh` cached object count tracking when deleting
  objects.
- `BoundaryInfo::renumber_id()`, now supporting automatic handling of
  id-to-name maps.
- `SIDE_HIERARCHIC` finite-element space support for `TET14` geometric
  elements.
- New `MeshBase::reinit_ghosting_functors()` API
- `reconnect_nodes()` API typedef, to enable forward compatibility
  with future data structure changes.
- Memory leak fix in `fparser`
- Fixes for `Poly2TriTriangulator` use with `DistributedMesh`, and for
  many corner cases
- Fix `TET10` numbering with `TetgenIO`
