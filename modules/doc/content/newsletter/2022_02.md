## MOOSE Improvements

### Thermal Hydraulics Module

The Thermal Hydraulics Module (THM), which serves as the foundation for
applications such as RELAP-7 and Sockeye, is now open-source and available as the
MOOSE [Thermal Hydraulics](modules/thermal_hydraulics/index.md) module. Some
key features of this module include:

- The [Components system](Components/index.md), which provides a higher-level
  syntax for assembling simulations. `Components` create the lower-level MOOSE
  objects like the mesh, kernels, and boundary conditions. This is particularly
  well-suited to systems-level applications that primarily operate on 0-D and
  1-D components that connect together.
- The [Control logic system](ControlLogic/index.md) provides a similar capability
  as MOOSE's [Controls system](Controls/index.md) but integrates with the `Components`
  system.
- Components using 1D, single-phase flow using the Euler equations, discretized
  with the finite volume method with the HLLC Riemann solver. These components
  include flow channels, inlets/outlets, junctions, valves, heating terms, and
  turbo-machinery such as pumps, compressors, and turbines.

### Lagrangian solid mechanics kernels

A new system of solid mechanics kernels are available in the
[tensor mechanics](modules/tensor_mechanics/index.md) module.
These kernels both duplicate the existing updated Lagrangian formulation
used in the current kernels and also add a new option for a total
Lagrangian formulation.  The main goal of this project was to
provide exact large deformation Jacobians without requiring the use of
AD to increase the efficiency of running large, finite deformation simulations.
The system 
[documentation](modules/tensor_mechanics/LagrangianKernelTheory.md)
includes a detailed description of the mathematical theory underlying the
kernels as well as information on the new features available along
with the kernels themselves.

Some of these new features include:

- Cartesian versions of a reformulated [updated Lagrangian](source/kernels/lagrangian/UpdatedLagrangianStressDivergence.md) kernel and a new
  [total Lagrangian](source/kernels/lagrangian/TotalLagrangianStressDivergence.md) kernel, both with exact large deformation Jacobians.
- [Stabilization](modules/tensor_mechanics/Stabilization.md) for linear triangular and tetraheadral elements.
- A [new material system](modules/tensor_mechanics/NewMaterialSystem.md), which provides new options for implementing
  material models, including options for defining material models with alternative stress measures.
- A new approach for applying an [objective integration](source/materials/lagrangian/  ComputeLagrangianObjectiveStress.md) to
  constitutive models defined in terms of the small (engineering) stress and strain to "promote" the response of these models
  to provide a large deformation material response.
- [Partial compatibility](source/materials/lagrangian/ComputeLagrangianWrappedStress.md) with the current MOOSE materials system.
- A [new homogenization subsystem](modules/tensor_mechanics/Homogenization.md) for applying cell-average stress or
  deformation constraints to periodic domains, useful for homogenizing the response of microstructural representative volume elements.

These changes, put together, should make it easier to run large deformation simulations, including
simulations with very large rotations or stretches.

The Lagrangian kernel system is included in the updated [tensor mechanics action](TensorMechanicsAction.md)
so users can switch between the current and Lagrangian kernels systems without significantly changing their
input files.

Over time additional features will be added to the Lagrangian kernel system to eventually bring it up
to full compatibility with the current kernels.  Some features the Lagrangian system currently lacks are:

- Axisymmetric and spherical coordinates.
- Generalized plane strain and plane stress formulations.
