# Introduction to Combined Thermo-Mechanical Contact

Users are expected to have worked through the
[Introduction to Tensor Mechanics](tensor_mechanics/tutorials/introduction/index.md) and
[Introduction to Contact](contact/tutorials/introduction/index.md)
tutorial first.

## [First thermal contact](combined/tutorials/introduction/step01.md)

Continuing from the [final step](contact/tutorials/introduction/step02.md) in
the mechanical contact tutorial we add a first attempt at thermal contact
staying within the mortar method.
