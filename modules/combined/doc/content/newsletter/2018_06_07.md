# MOOSE Newsletter (June 2018)

## MooseMesh::clone()

The `MooseMesh::clone()` interface returns a *reference* to the object it allocates, which
makes it easy to forget to explicitly delete the object when you are done with it. The
new `MooseMesh::safeClone()` method, which returns a `std::unique_ptr<MooseMesh>` should
be used instead. `MooseMesh::clone()` has been reimplemented as a `mooseError()` at the
base class level, and should no longer be called or overridden by user code. It will
eventually be removed altogether.

## PorousFlowJoiner materials

The [Porous Flow](modules/porous_flow/index.md) module now automatically adds all of the
[`PorousFlowJoiner`](PorousFlowJoiner.md) materials that are required, so there is no need
to include these pesky objects yourself! While your current input files will still continue
to run unchanged, you may want to delete these objects, and forget about them forevermore.

## Strain Periodicity

A new global strain [calculation](/GlobalStrainAction.md) approach has been implemented in the `TensorMechanics` module that relaxes the stresses along the periodic directions and allow corresponding deformation. It generates an auxiliary displacement [field](/GlobalDisplacementAux.md) which combined with periodic displacements enforces the strain periodicity. This approach enables capturing volume change, shear deformation, etc. while still maintaining periodic BC on the displacements.
