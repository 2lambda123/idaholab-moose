## MooseMesh::clone()

The `MooseMesh::clone()` interface returns a *reference* to the object it allocates, which
makes it easy to forget to explicitly delete the object when you are done with it. The
new `MooseMesh::safeClone()` method, which returns a `std::unique_ptr<MooseMesh>` should
be used instead. `MooseMesh::clone()` has been reimplemented as a `mooseError()` at the
base class level, and should no longer be called or overridden by user code. It will
eventually be removed altogether.
