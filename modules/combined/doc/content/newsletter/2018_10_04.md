# MOOSE Newsletter (October 2018)

## MOOSEDocs

We are continuing to improve documentation for MOOSE, you likely noticed that our website changed
recently. If you submitted a change to MOOSE you may of also noticed that we are mandating that
all test specifications files (i.e., "tests" files) that are new or modified include additional
language that details tests purpose, what system(s) it is testing, and what issues
are associated with the test.  This additional documentation serves two purposes, first it is
useful when trying to understand a test and second it is being used for software life cycle
documentation.

There is also ongoing work being done for converting "MOOSEDown" into LaTeX and there will be
more announcements on this task in the coming weeks and months.
