# Parallel Agnostic Random Number Generator Improvements

MOOSE's random number generator capabilities where improved during the month of August. While MOOSE has been able to generate random numbers agnostic of parallelism in most field-based calculations, the initial condition system was notably missing from this list. Developers may now access random numbers from within an initial that will remain consist as the number of processors or threads is changed.

# Improved API behavior for distance-based methods that take into account periodicity.

MOOSE has several methods that can return distances between points taking into account periodicity. Previously, these methods only worked with lines, rectangles and cubes. These methods can now be used on any domain shape and they will degrade properly (e.g. will return physical distances) when used on irregular domains.

# More GrainTracker Performance Improvements.

Performance of the Polycrystal Initial Condition object has been significantly improved. The complexity of the old algorithm has been reduced from $\large\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\dfrac{n}{o}\right)^2\right)$ to $\large\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $\large{n}$ represents the number of partial grain pieces and $\large{o}$ represents the number of order parameters used in the simulation. This improvement drastically reduces the setup time of very large simulations.

# New External Problem interface for MOOSE-wrapped Apps

A new `ExternalProblem` object has been merged into MOOSE. This new object improves the interface used for wrapping and coupling to external modeling and simulation software.
