## Control System Improved

The [Controls/index.md] was updated to improve performance and usability. With respect to performance
all parameters that are declared as controllable are cached during object creation. This allows
retrieval to be more efficient and easier; previously every object and parameter was interrogated
with every call to change it. With respect to usability, the get methods are no longer templates,
only the get/set methods require a template argument. This allows for Control objects to be generic,
for example the [SamplerReceiver.md] now allows for vector parameters to be modified.


## Work In Progress

We are working to improve Peacock by streamlining the interface to be as simple as possible for
day-to-day visualization, but will continue to add functionality via add preferences and menu level
controls.

Documentation is also a primary effort. Over the upcoming months will be re-organizing the files to
be one-to-one with header files. This will allow for all source code to be documented in a consistent
manner. Do not worry this will be automatic and the current arrangement will be maintained for some
time. We will also be working on updating the MOOSE workshop presentation, adding PDF support, and
will continue to add content.
