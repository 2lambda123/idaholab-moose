## Peacock Exodus Viewer Improvements

!row!

!col! class=s12 m12 l7
The results tab of peacock ("ExodusViewer") was updated, a screenshot is shown in [fig:exodus_tab]:

- Improvements were made to make the result refresh more efficient;
- The tab was redesigned to be more compact, with less frequented controls moved to menu items;
- The min/max toggles were redesigned to be cached with each variable as well as control if the
  automatic values should be computed via the visible or complete model;
- The block selection was made more compact with a drop down control.

It is possible to run peacock as an Exodus viewer alone by using the `--exodus` or `-r` flag
from the command line.

```bash
~/projects/moose/python/peacock/peacock -r path/to/an/exodus/file/here.e
```
