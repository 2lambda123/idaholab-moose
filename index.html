<p>The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated nonlinear solver technology on the planet.  MOOSE provides a straightforward API that aligns well with the real-world problems scientists and engineers need to tackle.  Every detail about how an engineer interacts with MOOSE has been thought through, from the installation process through running your simulation on state of the art supercomputers, the MOOSE system will accelerate your research.</p>

<p>Other computational frameworks throw a tarball with a README up on a server and leave you to figure everything else out on your own.  When you want to use a new version of that framework it is up to you to deal with the myriad of changes that have occurred.  When something goes wrong you get a response of "it's open source: go figure it out."  Even worse, many computational frameworks are developed <em>internally</em> leaving all external users feeling like second class citizens.</p>

<p>MOOSE is different.  MOOSE is a way of developing software just as much as it is a finite-element framework.  When we change something in the framework: we contribute patches to you that fix your application!  As MOOSE is developed we test against <em>your</em> tests each step of the way to ensure that we're not creating problems.  MOOSE is developed directly on GitHub providing a unique workflow that ensures smooth community involvement.  Every step of the way we make decisions to keep scientists and engineers doing... SCIENCE and ENGINEERING!</p>

<h3></a>Real results, really delivered</h3>

<p>
Don't simply talk about that simulation you would like to do.  Make it reality!  We specialize in making the easy stuff easy... and the impossible possible...
