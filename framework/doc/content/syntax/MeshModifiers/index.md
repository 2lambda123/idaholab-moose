# MeshModifiers

The `MeshModifiers` system is designed to be able to modify the connectivity of the MooseMesh.

## Postprocessing with MeshModifiers

For now, the mesh divisions can only be output using a [MeshDivisionAux.md].
We are planning to be able to compute averages, integrals, and various reductions
on mesh divisions, please stay tuned.

## Transferring with MeshModifiers

This feature is a work in progress.
