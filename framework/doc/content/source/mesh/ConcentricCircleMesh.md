# ConcentricCircleMesh

!syntax description /Mesh/ConcentricCircleMesh

## Description

The `ConcentricCircleMesh` object is to generate meshes for concentric circles. It would be useful to generate 2D meshes for typical LWR fuels. Users can refine meshes by providing higher number of rings for each specified concentric circle region or higher number of sectors in each quadrant. The test, [concentric_circle_mesh.i](test/tests/mesh/cconcentric_circle_mesh/concentric_circle_mesh.i), explains the use of the 'ConcentricCircleMesh' object. To execute the test only for generating 2D meshes,

```bash
~/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i concentric_circle_mesh.i --mesh-only
```

To execute the test with engineering and mathematical physics solvers,

```bash
~/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i concentric_circle_mesh.i
```

!alert note
Be aware: `ConcentricCircleMesh` only works with the ReplicatedMesh type when any half or full portions are used.

### More Information

`ConcentricCircleMesh` works by creating the first quadrant called "top_right." MooseEnum called portion controls which portion of meshes is generated. Any other one-fourth portions of circles are generated by rotating the "top_right" portion. Half portions are generated by stitching two different one-fourth portions depending on users' usages.

Users must provide the input parameters such as number of sectors in a quadrant, list of radii, list of rings, inner mesh fraction, boolean for the volume preserving function.
* list of radii: specific locations of radii of concentric circles
* list of rings: numbers of rings for concentric circles
* inner mesh fraction: ratio of the length of the inner square to the the radius of the innermost circle mesh
* volume for concentric circles can be preserved or not (on/off).

If the pitch length is given by users, then meshes for the moderator can be added to meshes for concentric circles. A portion can be specified, however, it is not required. The default setting generates the full concentric circles.

## Developer Information

If you're going to enhance `ConcentricCircleMesh,` may be developing the windmill approach for the moderator might be necessary. Algorithms for adding nodes and elements, including connectivity, might be necessary. They can be found in `ConcentricCircleMesh.C`.
