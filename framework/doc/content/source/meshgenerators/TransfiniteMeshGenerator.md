# TransfiniteMeshGenerator

The `TransfiniteMeshGenerator` produces two-dimensional meshes from a set of 4 corner vertices by interpolating the edges into the inner domain. The resulting mesh  consists of QUAD4 elements of aspect ratio and skewness determined by the points on the boundary edges.

## Overview

!media media/meshgenerators/quad_convention.png style=float:right;width:20%;margin-left:2%; caption=Fig. 1: Convention for the corner vertices order.

Given a set of 4 corners the TransfiniteMeshGenerator constructs by default the straight edges that connect the vertices and fills up the interior with straight lines. The test, [quadrilater_generator.i](test/tests/meshgenerators/transfinite_generator/quadrilater_generator.i),
illustrates the use of the `TransfiniteMeshGenerator` object to construct general quadrilaterals. The convention for the corners numbering should follow Fig. 1, prescribed in the order +(0,0) - (0,1) - (1,1) - (1,0)+. The direction along edges, important in case they are user provided using the DISCRETE option, should follow the direction in Fig. 1.

This generator allows any type of curvilinear edges. In Fig. 2 we show a mesh where the bottom edge has an inward arc circle. However, this algorithm generates a mesh for any parametrized edge, or given set of points on an edge. For arcs of a circle, since they are widely encounterened in applications, we customized an approach that requires from an user to specify only the deviation from a straight line in the middle of an edge. 

The distribution of points on an edge can be either provided as a discrete set of points, using the edge type `DISCRETE`, or as a bias along the edge. The only requirement is that opposite edges have the same number of points.

## Example 


This mesh generator considers 4 types of edges defined in `edge_type`, where `edge` is either left, right, top or bottom.


- `LINE`, constructs a line between provided corner vertices
- `ARCCIRC`, constructs an arc of a circle and requires an additional parameter, the distance at the middle of an edge between a straight line and the arc of circle desired. The edge is then generated by computing the middle point on the edge, which could be also obtained from a QUAD8 element from a mesh generator (if this capability is desired by a user please address the developers, as it is easy to adjust) 
- `DISCRETE`, constructs a line along a set of points provided by the user in the order represented by arrows in Fig. 1, a test is available as [discrete_generator.i](test/tests/meshgenerators/transfinite_generator/discrete_generator.i).
- `PARSED`, constructs a curvilinear edge as provided by a parametrization chosen by the user.


Each edge type may require additional parameters specified as `edge_parameter`, unless the edge is a line. For an arc circle and the deviation from a straight line is set by convention to be positive if the arc circle is outward, or negative if inward, as in Fig. 2, see test [arccircle_generator.i](test/tests/meshgenerators/transfinite_generator/arccircle_generator.i)


Two opposite sides need to have the same number of points, and we consider top-bottom edges to have `nx` points, and left-right edges `ny` points. By default they are taken to be equidistant, unless the user specifies a distancing via the parameters `bias_x` or `bias_y`.
