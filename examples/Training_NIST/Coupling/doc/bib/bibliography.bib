Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking. \par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.",

These configurations include fully consistent discretization of the Jacobian, preconditioner and residual of the Newton method, low-order preconditioning using a matrix-free method to approximate the action of the Jacobian, and defect correction or low-order Jacobian and preconditioning. The residual in loch case employs high- order discretization to preserve the high-order solution. Two preconditioners, point incomplete lower-upper factorization ILU(k) and block incomplete lower-upper factorization BILU(k) for k = 0,1,2 were applied. Also, one-way muitigriding and capping the inner iterations was applied to determine the behavior of the solution performance. It was determined that, overall, the configuration using low-order preconditioning with ILU(1), BILU(1), or BILU(2), mesh sequencing, and inner linear solve iterations capped at the same value of the dimension n, used with the GMRES(n) iterative solver (i.e., no restarts), performed best for time, memory, and robustness considerations."

We present direct experimental evidence that highly confined and controlled local contact at the ultrafine scale in the form of quasi-static nanoindentation of a bulk glassy metal alloy at room temperature can also cause nanocrystallization. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that nanocrystallites nucleate in and around shear bands produced near indents and that they are the same as crystallites formed during annealing without deformation at 783 kelvin. Analogous to results from recent experiments with glassy polymers, our results are reasoned to be a consequence of flow dilatation inside the bands and of the attendant, radically enhanced, atomic diffusional mobility inside actively deforming shear bands.",

The flow is modeled by the resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in three dimensions with constant resistivity. As a result of differential rotation (a gradient in vorticity parallel to the initial field), localized transient reconnection is observed on the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. Current amplification is observed along with the generation of parallel current. Results indicate that the observed transient reconnection rate is insensitive to resistivity (even with a constant resistivity model), but is sensitive to the initial flow shear."

Our major conclusion is that in order to model the containment of impurities, the background flow field must be known in detail. Comparing 1-D and 2-D solutions, hydrogen flow reversal plays an important role in the entrainment process. Further, the flow of particles from the core plasma also has a strong impact on the resultant entrainment of the impurities in both 1-D and 2-D. It is imperative that those components of poloidal velocity due to ExB and diamagnetic drifts be included in the models."

However, Lackner [K. Lackner, Comments Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 15, 359 (1994)] observed that the temperature profiles also must be the same to obtain the same atomic physics in the divertor region of similar discharges. He obtained a scaling indicating that none of the present tokamaks could be made similar to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [G. Janeschitz et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 220-222, 73 (1995)], but implicitly retained only two body interactions. Subsequent work [P. J. Catto et al., Phys. Plasmas 3, 3191 (1996)] demonstrated that non-two-body effects (multistep radiation, excitation, and ionization processes as well as three body recombination) cannot be ignored for plasma densities above 1019 m-3 the regime in which the ITER divertor must operate. In this reactor relevant regime, scaling law information must be obtained experimentally and by complex numerical simulations. To retain and quantify non-two-body effects on scaling laws we employ numerical simulations from a two dimensional box geometry version of the UEDGE code [D. A. Knoll et al., Phys. Plasmas 3, 293 (1996)] which includes a coupled plasma and neutral fluid description retaining non-two-body effects. Results are presented from a numerical investigation into the upstream parallel heat flux divided by upstream pressure scaling, as well as collisionality scaling, of the tokamak divertor target heat flux and ion saturation current."

The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information."

H. Hutchinson et al., Phys. Plasmas 1, 1511 (1994)]. The neutral model contains three momentum equations which are coupled to the plasma through ionization, recombination, and ion-neutral elastic collisions. The neutral transport coefficients are evaluated including both ion-neutral and neutral-neutral collisions. Detachment is brought about via impurity radiation using a fixed fraction impurity model. The transport model is shown to reproduce all salient features of experimentally observed detachment, such as large drops in ion saturation current and plasma heat flux at the divertor plate. The solutions are also shown to be sensitive to volume recombination. A region of relatively high toroidal neutral Mach number is observed upon detachment. Due to the high neutral densities, 75% of the Lyman radiation is assumed trapped in the problem. A total edge radiative loss (neutrals and impurities) of approximately 75% of the power crossing the separatrix is needed to observe strong detachment on Alcator-C-MOD-like plasmas using the described model."

    abstract = "Stiff wave systems are systems which exhibit a slow dynamical time scale while possessing fast wave phenomena. The physical effects of this fast wave may be important to the system, but resolving the fast time scale may not be required. When simulating such phenomena one would like to use time steps on the order of the dynamical scale for time integration. Historically, Semi-Implicit (SI) methods have been developed to step over the stiff wave time scale in a stable fashion. However, SI methods require some linearization and time splitting, and both of these can produce additional time integration errors. In this paper, the concept of using SI methods as preconditioners to Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods is developed. This algorithmic approach results in an implicitly balanced method (no linearization or time splitting). In this paper, we provide an overview of SI methods in a variety of applications, and a brief background on JFNK methods. We will present details of our new algorithmic approach. Finally, we provide an overview of results coming from problems in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)."

Newton-Krylov methods have proven dependable in solving nonlinear systems while not requiring the explicit formation or storage of the complete Jacobian. However, the standard algorithmic scaling of Krylov methods is nonoptimal, with increasing linear system dimension. This motivates our use of multigrid-based preconditioning. It is demonstrated that a simple multigrid-based preconditioner can effectively limit the growth of Krylov iterations as the dimension of the linear system is increased. Different performance aspects of the proposed algorithm are investigated on three nonlinear, nonsymmetric, boundary value problems. Our goal is to develop a hybrid methodology which has Newton-Krylov nonlinear convergence properties and multigrid-like linear convergence scaling for large scale simulation."

Typically, this type of calculation is performed using operator-splitting where the nonlinearities are lagged one time step. This method of integrating the nonlinear system results in an effective time-step constraint to obtain accuracy. A time-step control that limits the change in dependent variables (usually energy) per time step is used. We investigate the possibility that converging the nonlinearities within a time step may allow significantly larger time-step sizes and improved accuracy as well. The previously described Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method (JQSRT 63 (1999) 15) is used to converge all nonlinearities within a time step. In addition, a new time-step control method, based on the hyperbolic model of a thermal wave (J. Comput. Phys. 152 (1999) 790), is employed. The benefits and cost of a second-order accurate time step are considered. It is demonstrated that for a chosen accuracy, significant increases in solution efficiency can be obtained by converging nonlinearities within a time step."

The effects of the Jacobian are probed only through approximate matrix-vector products required in the conjugate gradient-like iteration. The methodology behind the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method is given in detail.

A segregated (distributed, block triangular) preconditioning strategy is being developed for the Newton-Krylov solver. In this preconditioning approach we are only required to approximately invert matrices coming from a single field variable, not matrices arising from a coupled system. Additionally, simple linearizations are used in constructing our preconditioning operators. The preconditioning strategy is presented along with the performance of the methods. We consider problems in phase-change heat transfer and the thermally driven incompressible Navier-Stokes equations separately. This is a required intermediate step toward developing a successful preconditioning strategy for the fully coupled physics problem."

The observations suggest that open and closed field lines reconnect near the cusp of the helmet streamer to form blobs of higher density plasmas that are ejected into the slow solar wind. Models of this process have been suggested, and simulation studies have been conducted. We take the recent simulation work of Einaudi et al. as our starting point to investigate the formation of the slow solar wind and of the blobs observed by LASCO. We report two main conclusions. First, our results confirm the overall scenario suggested in the above paper ( Einaudi et al.), which is that reconnection indeed causes the formation of blobs and the acceleration of the slow solar wind. Second, by employing more realistic two-dimensional configurations including the cusp and bent field lines with fast solar wind flow, we find that reconnection giving rise to plasma blobs is driven by converging flows with reconnection rates largely insensitive to changes in resistivity."

It is well known that reconnection in such systems progresses orders of magnitude too slow to explain observations, even when full kinetic models are used. We consider here a new possible mechanism for fast reconnection in such systems. We consider the effect of the possible presence of velocity shear that can drive the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The effect of the KHI is shown to convert shear flow into compression flow that drives reconnection. Three scaling effects can be discerned in the simulations. First, the reconnection rate is directly controlled by the driving mechanism which is provided by the KHI. The result of this new mechanism is that fast reconnection can be achieved even in absence of anomalous resistivity. Second, the effect of varying the initial sheared flow along the main magnetic field direction enhances the reconnection process. Finally, the reconnection rate is insensitive to the value of resistivity."

    abstract = "An inexact Newton method is used to solve the steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes and energy equation. Finite volume differencing is employed on a staggered grid using the power law scheme of Patankar. Natural convection in an enclosed cavity is studied as the model problem. Two conjugate-gradient -like algorithms based upon the Lanczos biorthogonalization procedure are used to solve the linear systems arising on each Newton iteration. The first conjugate-gradient-like algorithm is the transpose-free quasi-minimal residual algorithm (TFQMR) and the second is the conjugate gradients squared algorithm (CGS). Incomplete lower-upper (ILU) factorization of the Jacobian matrix is used as a right preconditioner. The performance of the Newton- TFQMR algorithm is studied with regard to different choices for the TFQMR convergence criteria and the amount of fill-in allowed in the ILU factorization. Performance data are compared with results using the Newton-CGS algorithm and previous results using LINPACK banded Gaussian elimination (direct-Newton). The inexact Newton algorithms were found to be CPU competetive with the direct-Newton algorithm for the model problem considered. Among the inexact Newton algorithms, Newton-CGS outperformed Newton- TFQMR with regard to CPU time but was less robust because of the sometimes erratic CGS convergence behaviour."

These methods are categorized by their temporal order of accuracy, whether the algorithm includes operator splitting, and whether the algorithm includes linearizations. Results are presented that simultaneously measure accuracy and efficiency of the different methods on two different test problems. The two test problems are designed to represent an easy problem, where different approximations may be accurate, and a hard test problem that will stress the different solution algorithms. Results show the importance of being second-order accurate in time and the importance of time-step control."

Since the method is implicit, and therefore unconditionally stable, time steps may be used that result in both gravity wave Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers and advection CFL numbers being larger than one. By nonlinearly consistent it is meant that all of the unknown variables appear at the same time level in the equations and are solved for simultaneously in an iterative manner (i.e., no splitting errors in time). The INC method is compared to a more traditional semi-implicit method for stepping over the gravity wave stability constraint. Results are presented that show that the second-order-in-time INC method can maintain a high level of accuracy if the dynamical timescale of the system is resolved by the time step. To investigate this difference in temporal integration accuracy between the nonlinearly consistent method and the semi-implicit method an approximate modified equation analysis was performed. The INC solution technique employed is the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. Preconditioning of the JFNK method is achieved via a semi-implicit solution method. The height matrix from the semi-implicit algorithm is solved using a multigrid linear solver to provide efficiency and scalability."

This system of nonlinear equations is solved by coupling three numerical methods, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov, operator splitting, and multigrid linear solvers. An inexact Newton's method is used to solve the system of nonlinear equations. Since building the Jacobian matrix for problems of interest can be challenging, we employ a Jacobian-free implementation of Newton's method, where the action of the Jacobian matrix on a vector is approximated by a first order Taylor series expansion. Preconditioned generalized minimal residual (PGMRES) is the Krylov method used to solve the linear systems that come from the iterations of Newton's method. The preconditioner in this solution method is constructed using a physics-based divide and conquer approach, often referred to as operator splitting. This solution procedure inverts the scalar elliptic systems that make up the preconditioner using simple multigrid methods. The preconditioner also addresses the strong coupling between equations with local $2\cross 2$ block solves. The intra-cell coupling is applied after the inter-cell coupling has already been addressed by the elliptic solves. Results are presented using this solution procedure that demonstrate its efficiency while incurring minimal memory requirements."

abstract = {On the basis of a critical assessment of the Booth-Speight model for the fission gas release from irradiated fuel, a more consistent mechanistic approach is developed for consideration of the microstructure evolution and fission gas release under conditions of power ramp tests. A new model that modifies the Nelson model for gas atom resolution from bubbles and explains the observed formation of a new population of large bubbles, is developed and implemented in the MFPR code. Superposition of various mechanisms of gas transport: gas atom diffusion, bubbles random and biased migration, and gas sweeping by grain boundaries, results in a reasonable prediction of the measured fractional gas release and microstructure evolution, observed in the ramp tests. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These equations allow the specification of mesh characteristics by using an approximate metric tensor. Indeed, it is often possible to prescribe final mesh criteria by forming, on an element by element basis, an ideal target element representation that is based upon local modification of the existing mesh state. The use of a prescriptive target metric as a solution-dependent diffusion tensor in the Laplace-Beltrami procedure results in the LBTM method; an elliptic mesh generation method that is robust with respect to domains containing complex convex or concave boundaries. This presentation discusses the mechanics of the LBTM method and its application to selected example problems."

The use of a prescriptive target metric as a solution-dependent diffusion tensor in the Laplace-Beltrami approach results in the Laplace-Beltrami Target Metric (LBTM) method; an elliptic mesh generation method that is robust with respect to domains containing complex, evolving, geometry. To implement adaptation, an ideal element target metric is calculated that combines the isoparametric map of the element with a solution quality metric and/or vector field information. This talk presents recent work in using the ``coarse-graining'' algorithm to calculate a target tensor that implements both adaptivity in element size and a field-line following coordinate mapping."
